Diving into imaging is a great experience. I have engaged in many imaging techniques, including light, fluorescence, laser scanning microscopy, as part of my work. I find immense joy in appreciating the aesthetic aspects of biology through the art of imaging. Feel free to explore my gallery for a visual journey into my work. ::: {layout-nrow="1" layout-valign="bottom"} ![Sperm of Platynereis dumerilii labeled in orange pumpkin (nuclei) and olive (standard lissaminated morpholino)](gamete-carving.jpg){group="my-gallery" height="128px" width="128px"}
