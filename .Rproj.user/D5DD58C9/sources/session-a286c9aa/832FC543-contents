I hail from São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil, boasting a rich heritage that spans Native Brazilian roots from the Guajajara tribe, alongside African and Iberian ancestry. From a tender age, my fascination with science took root. Eventually, I pursued my passion, becoming a biologist. During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to a remarkable realm inhabited by creatures both delicate and conspicuous—polychaetes, which are marine segmented worms. I have navigated through various projects studying these worms, spanning taxonomy, ecology, systematics, reproduction, and ultimately, regeneration. Sometimes my adventures led me to the middle of a mangrove, collecting worms from the mud; sometimes, I found myself scuba diving in paradisiacal oceanic islands, and most times, I was on the lab bench, pipetting or counting segments.

During this exploration, I found out how amazing these worms are at regenerating, and I realized: this is my calling. Fascinated by the remarkable power of regeneration these worms possess, my research has become a quest to comprehend the mechanisms by which their cells proliferate and differentiate into any cell type, and how these mechanisms help worms to defy the passage of time and live indefinitely.

Although the work is nice, for a balanced life, I like to spend time with my family, I keep a fitness schedule for strenght, and I love dancing all styles: salsa, bachata, kizomba, all brazilian rithms (axe, funk, pisadinha) and yes, I'm also a pole dancer.
