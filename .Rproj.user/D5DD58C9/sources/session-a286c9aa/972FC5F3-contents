Diving into imaging is a great experience. I have engaged in many imaging techniques, including light, fluorescence and laser scanning microscopy, as part of my work. I find immense joy in appreciating the aesthetic aspects of biology through the art of imaging. Feel free to explore my gallery for a visual journey into my work.
