### Imaging

I engage extensively in imaging techniques, including confocal and light microscopy, as part of my work. I find immense joy in appreciating the aesthetic aspects of biology through the art of imaging. Feel free to explore my gallery for a visual journey into my work.

### Comics

I have a passion for comics, and during my PhD, I began illustrating them to creatively convey my research findings. My aspiration is to craft a unique comic for each of my future publications whenever feasible. These comics aim to present the key insights from my research articles in an enjoyable and engaging manner. Rather than adhering to a strict publishing schedule, I let my creativity and current mindset guide me through the scientific storytelling process. Take a peek at the comics I've created thus far.
