## **Regeneration and reproduction**

![Ranny studies regeneration and reproduction in marine segmented worms, or annelids. During her PhD, she explored the variability in regenerative abilities and its correlation with the evolutionary aspects of annelid reproductive modes. She used different tools to investigate regeneration in a group of annelids called syllids, including RNAseq, bioinformatics and immunohistochemestry. Currently, she interested in unraveling the mysteries of how these organisms harness their regenerative abilities to lead extended lifespans, manipulating the intricate regulation of reproduction in the process.What sets annelids apart from other highly regenerative organisms, such as planarians and cnidarians, is the absence of specialized stem cells dedicated to regeneration. This absence raises a compelling question: how do they achieve remarkable regenerative feats without relying on specific cell types? Unraveling this mystery holds the potential to manipulate regenerative processes in various cell types, including those found in vertebrates. The research sheds light on the fascinating world of annelid regeneration, opening avenues for broader applications in tissue regeneration and cellular differentiation.](dramasyllis.jpg){height="448" fig-align="left"}



## **Annelid diversity and evolution**

![Ranny has dedicated numerous years to the study of the diversity of polychaetes. Embarking on her scientific journey by collecting specimens from the mangroves of her hometown, Maranh√£o, Brazil, her initial venture into science involved taxonomical description of polychaetes. Having overseen two projects for Bachelors and a Masters degree, and through collaborative research set alongside, she has described 15 polychaete species.](images/annelid.jpg){height="448px" fig-align="left"}
