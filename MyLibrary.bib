	abstract = {Background The overall anatomy of the genus Syllis (Annelida: Syllidae) has been largely studied; however, an integrative approach considering different anatomical techniques has never been considered. Here, we use micro-computed X-ray tomography (micro-CT) to examine the internal anatomy of Syllis gracilis Grube, 1840, along with other widely available techniques. Methods We studied the anatomy of the marine annelid S. gracilis through an integrative approach, including micro-CT along with stereo and light compound microscopy (STM, LCM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and histological sectioning (HIS). In this manner, we evaluated the applicability of micro-CT for the examination of annelid anatomy by testing whether the images obtained make it possible to visualize the main body structures, in comparison with other current techniques, of the various elements of its internal anatomy. Results Overall external and internal body elements are clearly shown by the integrative use of all techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of each when studied separately.Any given method shows disparate results, depending on the body part considered. For instance, micro-CT provided good images of the external anatomy, including relevant characters such as the shape, length and number of articles of dorsal parapodial cirri. However, it is especially useful for the examination of internal anatomy, thus allowing for 3D visualization of the natural spatial arrangement of the different organs. The features best visualized are those of higher tissue density (i.e., body musculature, anterior parts of the digestive tract), particularly in 3D images of unstained specimens, whereas less electrodense tissues (i.e., the peritoneal lining of septa and nervous system) are less clearly visualized. The use of iodine stain with micro-CT has shown advantages against non-staining for the adequate observation of delicate elements of low density, such as the segmental organs, the connective between the ganglia, the ventral nerve cord and segmental nerves. Discussion Main external anatomical elements of S. gracilis are well shown with micro-CT, but images show lesser optical resolution and contrast when compared to micrographs provided by SEM and CLSM, especially for fine structural features of chaetae. Comparison of micro-CT and HIS images revealed the utility and reliability of the former to show the presence, shape and spatial disposition of most internal body organs; the resolution of micro-CT images at a cellular level is, however, much lower than that of HIS, which makes both techniques complementary.},

En el laboratorio Syllide Grubea pusilla DUJARDIN, que había estado en el laboratorio durante 21.5 años, ahora se podía establecer una reproducción continua, puramente partenogenética. Cabe destacar que las especies relacionadas, como Grubea clavata y los miembros de los géneros Exogone y Sphaerosyllis, se reproducen exclusivamente de forma bisexual, y sus huevos nunca se desarrollan, aunque no sea facultativamente, sin fertilizar.Grubea pusilla ha estado en conchas PetRI por 6 generacionesCon 5 mm de nivel de agua en una fina capa de arena. El puerto deportivo de Oxyrrhis sirvió como alimento, un dinoflagelado heterotrófico para ser alimentado con Chlamydomonas. En todas las generaciones, todos los individuos (500 a 600 en total) se convirtieron en hembras, mientras que los machos no aparecieron en absoluto. Cuando el huevo maduró, las hembras, así como las especies bisexuales relacionadas, formaron cerdas flotantes especiales, se arremolinaron vigorosamente y finalmente dieron los huevos formados en pares en los segmentos medios (máximo 18 piezas). Los huevos depositados, que están unidos al lado ventral de la madre, siempre se desarrollaron sin excepción, aunque solo alrededor de 2/3 de lo normal. Las larvas jóvenes, que inicialmente se alimentan de su suministro de yema, también permanecen unidas a la madre hasta el final de la metamorfosis. Un examen detallado de 40 hembras en diversas etapas del desarrollo del huevo reveló en todos los casos la ausencia de espermatozoides en el coelom. Por lo tanto, la posibilidad parece imposible, que se vincule en G. pusilla a un hermafrodita con autofecundación obligatoria (como Capitornaslus minimus): el curso de desarrollo no perturbado ya en la sexta generación sugiere que estaba en la partenogénesis observada a la Reproducción normal de Grubea pusilla.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In marine soft-sediment habitats, tissue loss by infuanal invertebrates can provide significant energetic input to higher trophic levels, have substantial impacts on individual behavior, growth, and fecundity, and resulting changes in bioturbation rates can secondarily affect community dynamics. The degree to which a community is affected by such sublethal predation depends in part on whether injured individuals can regenerate and on the speed at which they do so. Previously, we demonstrated differences in the rate of anterior segment and palp regeneration by the spionid polychaetes Pygospio elegans and Dipolydora quadrilobata. The current study examined the morphology of the anterior segment and palp regeneration in these species using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and indirect immunohistochemistry with confocal laser scanning microscopy at 3, 6, 9, and 12?d post-ablation. Antibodies for acetylated α-tubulin and the neural tetrapeptide FMRFamide were used to label the regenerating nervous system. SEM revealed that the morphology of anterior tissue regeneration was similar for both species, but the ciliated food groove tended to form sooner on palps in P. elegans than on those of D. quadrilobata. In both species, palp regeneration and ciliated food groove formation were faster when only palps were removed. A shortened ciliated food groove is likely to reduce particle contact and transport efficiency in suspension and deposit feeding. Regenerating palp nerves were initially visible at 3?d following ablation of palps only, but at 6?d following ablation of five anterior segments. Following ablation of anterior segments, the regenerating nervous system was largely complete by 9?d, nuchal organs were innervated by 6?d, and processes of palp sensory cells were visible at 12?d. Contact chemoreception by sensory cells on the palps may be diminished during the early stages of regeneration, but chemoreception of waterborne cues via the nuchal organ should not.},

The phylogenetic analysis is based on 55 characters; a strict consensus Of 1200 equally parsimonious trees (length = 314 steps) was obtained. The clades containing species usually included within Pionosyllis are newly named within the frame of a new Linnean classification of the group (except for one, belonging to another subfamily).

Paraehlersia San Martin, 2003, proved to be closely related to Pionosyllis. Seven species are transferred to Opisthodonta Langerhans, 1879, here emended, and three transferred to Nudisyllis Knox \& Cameron, 1970 (according to San Martin \& Hutchings, 2006). Opisthodonta uraga (Imajima, 1966) comb. nov. and Perkinsyllis longisetosa comb. nov. are redescribed.

	abstract = {Animals that can reproduce by both asexual agametic reproduction and sexual reproduction must transmit or re-establish their germ line post-embryonically. Although such a dual reproductive mode has evolved repeatedly among animals, how asexually produced individuals establish their germ line remains poorly understood in most groups. We investigated germ line development in the annelid Pristina leidyi, a species that typically reproduces asexually by paratomic fission, intercalating a new tail and head in the middle of the body followed by splitting. We found that in fissioning individuals, gonads occur in anterior segments in the anterior-most individual as well as in new heads forming within fission zones. Homologs of the germ line/multipotency genes piwi, vasa, and nanos are expressed in the gonads, as well as in proliferative tissues including the posterior growth zone, fission zone, and regeneration blastema. In fissioning animals, certain cells on the ventral nerve cord express a homolog of piwi, are abundant near fission zones, and sometimes make contact with gonads. Such cells are typically undetectable near the blastema and posterior growth zone. Time-lapse imaging provides direct evidence that cells on the ventral nerve cord migrate preferentially towards fission zones. Our findings indicate that gonads form routinely in fissioning individuals, that a population of piwi-positive cells on the ventral nerve cord is associated with fission and gonads, and that cells resembling these piwi-positive cells migrate along the ventral nerve cord. We suggest that the piwi-positive ventral cells are germ cells that transmit the germ line across asexually produced individuals via migration along the ventral nerve cord.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During embryonic development of segmented animals, body segments are thought to arise from the so-called "posterior growth zone" and the occurrence of this "zone" has been used to support the homology of segmentation between arthropods, annelids, and vertebrates. However, the term "posterior growth zone" is used ambiguously in the literature, mostly referring to a region of increased proliferation at the posterior end of the embryo. To determine whether such a localised posterior proliferation zone is an ancestral feature of Panarthropoda (Onychophora + Tardigrada + Arthropoda), we examined cell division patterns in embryos of Onychophora. RESULTS: Using in vivo incorporation of the DNA replication marker BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) and anti-phospho-histone H3 immunolabelling, we found that a localised posterior region of proliferating cells does not occur at any developmental stage in onychophoran embryos. This contrasts with a localised pattern of cell divisions at the posterior end of annelid embryos, which we used as a positive control. Based on our data, we present a mathematical model, which challenges the paradigm that a localised posterior proliferation zone is necessary for segment patterning in short germ developing arthropods. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a posterior proliferation zone was absent in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda. By comparing our data from Onychophora with those from annelids, arthropods, and chordates, we suggest that the occurrence of a "posterior growth zone" currently cannot be used to support the homology of segmentation between these three animal groups.},

	abstract = {We report the characterisation of a Brachyury ortholog (PvuBra) in the marine gastropod Patella vulgata. In this mollusc, the embryo displays an equal cleavage pattern until the 32-cell stage. There, an inductive event takes place that sets up the bilateral symmetry, by specifying one of the four initially equipotent vegetal macromeres as the posterior pole of all subsequent morphogenesis. This macromere, usually designated as 3D, will subsequently act as an organiser. We show that 3D expresses PvuBra as soon as its fate is determined. As reported for another mollusc ( J. D. Lambert and L. M. Nagy (2001) Development , -56), we found that 3D determination and activity also involve the activation of the MAP kinase ERK, and we further show that PvuBra expression in 3D requires ERK activity. PvuBra expression then rapidly spreads to neighbouring cells that cleave in a bilateral fashion and whose progeny will constitute the posterior edge of the blastopore during gastrulation, suggesting a role for PvuBra in regulating cell movements and cleavage morphology in Patella. Until the completion of gastrulation, PvuBra expression is maintained at the posterior pole, and along the developing anterior-posterior axis. Comparing this expression pattern with what is known in other Bilateria, we advocate that Brachyury might have a conserved role in the regulation of anterior-posterior patterning among Bilateria, through the maintenance of a posterior growth zone, suggesting that a teloblastic mode of axis formation might be ancestral to the Bilateria.},

	abstract = {How does the nervous system produce behavior? The desire to answer this question has led investigators to examine the biophysical properties of individual neu- rons and their synaptic connectivity during the produc- tion of specific behaviors (i.e. motor neuron impulse patterns). In order to accomplish this task ‘simple' preparations were necessary where the activity of iden- tified neurons could be directly correlated with behav- ior. Such preparations needed to be amenable to physiological recording techniques (primarily intracellu- lar recording) while still producing a recognizable mo- tor pattern. These requirements necessitated the use of reduced preparations: semi-intact and isolated nervous systems. The relative ease with which neuronal activity can be monitored in neuronal cell bodies, the simplicity of both the nervous system and the musculature, and its small repertoire of behaviors made the medicinal leech an ideal preparation to address how the nervous system produces behavior in terms of synaptic interactions between identified neurons. In this article, we will de- scribe the organization of the leech nervous system, the experimental approach employed in characterizing identified neurons in the leech, and the extent to which the goal of understanding the neuronal basis of behav- ior has been accomplished with respect to leech swim- ming. We will also discuss how the initial focus of this research has expanded to take into account the role that neurotransmitters play in controlling swimming, how the decision to swim is processed and the behav- ioral specificity of identified neurons.},

	abstract = {Polynoid scale worms (Polynoidae, Annelida) invaded deep-sea chemosynthesis-based ecosystems approximately 60 million years ago, but little is known about their genetic adaptation to the extreme deep-sea environment. In this study, we reported the first two transcriptomes of deep-sea polynoids (Branchipolynoe pettiboneae, Lepidonotopodium sp.) and compared them with the transcriptome of a shallow-water polynoid (Harmothoe imbricata). We determined codon and amino acid usage, positive selected genes, highly expressed genes and putative duplicated genes. Transcriptome assembly produced 98,806 to 225,709 contigs in the three species. There were more positively charged amino acids (i.e., histidine and arginine) and less negatively charged amino acids (i.e., aspartic acid and glutamic acid) in the deep-sea species. There were 120 genes showing clear evidence of positive selection. Among the 10\% most highly expressed genes, there were more hemoglobin genes with high expression levels in both deep-sea species. The duplicated genes related to DNA recombination and metabolism, and gene expression were only enriched in deep-sea species. Deep-sea scale worms adopted two strategies of adaptation to hypoxia in the chemosynthesis-based habitats (i.e., rapid evolution of tetra-domain hemoglobin in Branchipolynoe or high expression of single-domain hemoglobin in Lepidonotopodium sp.). © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The emergence of new technologies from the genomics revolution will transform the potential application of biomarkers to assess how pollutants impact people, animals, and ecosystems. Genetic databases provide a huge resource from which candidate molecular biomarkers can be identified and, subsequently, exploited to address these issues. However, a major challenge is to link these novel molecular indices to ecologically relevant whole-organism life-cycle traits (such as reproduction and growth). Such a functional link is provided by annetocin, previously characterized as a member of the vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily of neuropeptides. It is expressed in annelid worms within the neurons of the central nervous system and has been shown to be involved in the induction of egg-laying behavior. This paper outlines the validation of annetocin as a novel biomarker of reproductive fitness in the earthworm Eisenia fetida. The design of primer pairs targeted toward oligochaete annetocin has facilitated the isolation of a full-length annetocin cDNA from this species. Optimization of a real-time quantitative PCR procedure exploiting the fluorescent DNA-binding molecule, Sybr Green, has allowed the measurement of annetocin transcript levels over a range covering six orders of magnitude. Using this approach, gene expression was measured in earthworms exposed to soils polluted with high concentrations of zinc and lead. Traditional growth and reproductive indices, including cocoon production, were also recorded and related to the molecular parameter. The future use of annetocin as a molecular genetic biomarker in terrestrial ecotoxicology is discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Next-generation sequencing techniques have the capability of yielding massive amounts of gene sequence data for virtually any species at a modest cost. Here we provide a comparative analysis of de novo assembled transcriptomic data for ten non-model species of previously understudied animal taxa.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: cDNA libraries of ten species belonging to five animal phyla (2 Annelida [including Sipuncula], 2 Arthropoda, 2 Mollusca, 2 Nemertea, and 2 Porifera) were sequenced in different batches with an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (read length 100 or 150 bp), rendering between ca. 25 and 52 million reads per species. Read thinning, trimming, and de novo assembly were performed under different parameters to optimize output. Between 67,423 and 207,559 contigs were obtained across the ten species, post-optimization. Of those, 9,069 to 25,681 contigs retrieved blast hits against the NCBI non-redundant database, and approximately 50\% of these were assigned with Gene Ontology terms, covering all major categories, and with similar percentages in all species. Local blasts against our datasets, using selected genes from major signaling pathways and housekeeping genes, revealed high efficiency in gene recovery compared to available genomes of closely related species. Intriguingly, our transcriptomic datasets detected multiple paralogues in all phyla and in nearly all gene pathways, including housekeeping genes that are traditionally used in phylogenetic applications for their purported single-copy nature.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: We generated the first study of comparative transcriptomics across multiple animal phyla (comparing two species per phylum in most cases), established the first Illumina-based transcriptomic datasets for sponge, nemertean, and sipunculan species, and generated a tractable catalogue of annotated genes (or gene fragments) and protein families for ten newly sequenced non-model organisms, some of commercial importance (i.e., Octopus vulgaris).

	abstract = {Leech swimming is produced by the antiphasic contractions of dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles that travel rearward along the animal and propel it forward. Research over the past three decades has focused on identifying the underlying neuronal circuit and mechanisms that produce and control this coordinated movement pattern. Investigations have also tested whether leech swimming is modifiable, both by experience and by neuromodulators. One outcome has been the identification of several functional classes of neurons associated with swimming. Systematic analysis of the interactions between these neurons had led to the elucidation of a neuronal circuit that adequately accounts for the generation of the swim motor program cord. The swim motor program appears to be produced by a chain of coupled segmental oscillators whose intrinsic properties and intersegmental connections ensure the coordinated expression of swimming along the nerve cord. In addition, neurons identified in the head ganglion comprise two parallel, but opposite- acting, systems that control the initiation of swimming in response to sensory input. Also, the pathway by which body wall stimulation initiates swimming shows a simple form of learning, that is habituation. Repeatedly stroking the leech body wall decreases both the probability of initiating swimming and the length of elicited swim episodes. Finally, the biogenic amine serotonin, which is found in the nerve cord, affects leech swimming in a number of ways. Serotonin's modulation of swimming is due, in part, to its effect on the membrane properties of swim-initiating interneurons and several swim motor neurons.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii (Polychaeta, Nereididae) has been recognized as a slow-evolving lophotrochozoan that attracts increasing attention as a valuable model for evolutionary and developmental research. Here, we analyzed its immune-related transcriptome. For targeted identification of immune-induced genes we injected bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a commonly used elicitor of innate immune responses, and applied the suppression subtractive hybridization technique that selectively amplifies cDNAs of differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of 288 cDNAs revealed induced expression of numerous genes whose potential homologues from other animals mediate recognition of infection (e.g. complement receptor CD35), signaling (e.g. myc and SOCS), or act as effector molecules like ferritins and the bactericidal permeability-increasing protein. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses implicate that immune-related genes identified in P. dumerilii are more related to counterparts from Deuterostomia than are those from Ecdysozoa, similarly as recently described for opsin and intron-rich genes. CONCLUSION: Obtained results may allow for a better understanding of Platynereis immunity and support the view that P. dumerilii represents a suitable model for analyzing immune responses of Lophotrochozoa.},

Each of these behaviors is known to be associated with formation of the cocoon in which eggs are deposited. In fact, some of the earthworms injected with annetocin ({\textbackslash}textgreater 5 nmol) laid eggs. Such egg-laying-related behaviors except for oviposition were also induced by oxytocin, but not by Arg-vasopressin and some other bioactive peptides isolated from E. foetida. Furthermore, annetocin also induced these egg-laying-like behaviors in the leech Whitmania pigra, but not in the polychaete Perinereis vancaurica.

Increasingly, studies are using a comparative approach (across species, sexes and life stages) that examines the transcriptional basis of phenotypic diversity within an evolutionary context. In the present review, we summarize much of this research, focusing in particular on three critical aspects of insect biology: morphological development and plasticity; physiological response to the environment; and sexual dimorphism. A common feature that is emerging from these investigations concerns the dynamic nature of transcriptome evolution as indicated by rapid changes in the overall pattern of gene expression, the differential expression of numerous genes with unknown function, and the incorporation of novel, lineage-specific genes into the transcriptional profile.},

In previous experiments, focal application of L-glutamate or its non-NMDA agonists onto either the segmental swim-gating interneuron (cell 204) or the serotonergic Retzius cell resulted in prolonged excitation of the two cells and often in fictive swimming. Since brief stimulation of the subesophageal trigger interneuron (cell Tr1) evoked a similar response, we investigated the role of glutamate at these synapses. Kynurenic acid and two non-NMDA antagonists, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) and Joro spider toxin, effectively suppressed (1) the sustained activation of cell 204 and the Retzius cell following cell Tr1 stimulation and (2) the monosynaptic connection from cell Tr1 to cell 204 and the Retzius cell, but did not block spontaneous or DP nerve-activated swimming. Other glutamate blockers, including gamma-D-glutamylaminomethyl sulfonic acid, L(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonoproprionic acid and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, were ineffective. DNQX also blocked both indirect excitation of cell 204 and direct depolarization of cell Tr1 in response to mechanosensory P cell stimulation. Our findings show the involvement of non-NMDA receptors in activating the swim motor program at two levels: (1) P cell input to cell Tr1 and (2) cell Tr1 input to cell 204, and reveal an essential role for glutamate in swim initiation via the cell Tr1 pathway.},

	abstract = {Enchytraeus japonensis is a small oligochaete that reproduces mainly asexually by fragmentation (autotomy) and regeneration. As sexual reproduction can also be induced, it is a good animal model for the study of both somatic and germline stem cells. To clarify the features of stem cells in regeneration, we investigated the proliferation and lineage of stem cells in E. japonensis. Neoblasts, which have the morphological characteristics of undifferentiated cells, were found to firmly adhere to the posterior surface of septa in each trunk segment. Also, smaller neoblast-like cells, which are designated as N-cells in this study, were located dorsal to the neoblasts on the septa. By conducting 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling-experiments, we have shown that neoblasts are slow-cycling (or quiescent) in intact growing worms, but proliferate rapidly in response to fragmentation. N-cells proliferate more actively than do neoblasts in intact worms. The results of pulse-chase experiments indicated that neoblast and N-cell lineage mesodermal cells that incorporated BrdU early in regeneration migrated toward the autotomized site to form the mesodermal region of the blastema, while the epidermal and intestinal cells also contributed to the blastema locally near the autotomized site. We have also shown that neoblasts have stem cell characteristics by expressing Ej-vlg2 and by the activity of telomerase during regeneration. Telomerase activity was high in the early stage of regeneration and correlated with the proliferation activity in the neoblast lineage of mesodermal stem cells. Taken together, our results indicate that neoblasts are mesodermal stem cells involved in the regeneration of E. japonensis.},

In whole-mounted tissue, small cells of the outer capsule and putative microglia labeled with both GluR 5/6/7 and GluR 2/3 but not NMDAR 1 subunit antisera. In general, GluR 5/6/7-like immunofluorescence was both more intense and more widespread than GluR 2/3-like immunolabeling. Cryostat-sectioned tissue revealed extensive GluR 5/6/7-like immunoreactivity throughout the neuropil as well as labeling within a few neuronal somata. GLT-1-like immunoreactivity localized to the inner capsule, which is the interface between neuronal somata and the neuropil and is deeply invested by processes of neuropil glia. These results complement previous physiological and pharmacological findings indicating that the leech CNS possesses the cellular machinery to respond to glutamate and to transport glutamate from extracellular spaces. Together, they provide further evidence for glutamate's role as a neurotransmitter within the leech CNS.},

Here, we have used germ line markers (piwi, vasa, and nanos) and microinjected cell lineage tracers to show that PGC specification in the leech genus Helobdella follows a different scenario: in this hermaphrodite, the male and female PGCs segregate from somatic lineages only after more than 20 rounds of zygotic mitosis; the male and female PGCs share the same (mesodermal) cell lineage for 19 rounds of zygotic mitosis. Moreover, while all three markers are expressed in both male and female reproductive tissues of the adult, they are expressed differentially between the male and female PGCs of the developing embryo: piwi and vasa are expressed preferentially in female PGCs at a time when nanos is expressed preferentially in male PGCs. A priori, the delayed segregation of male and female PGCs from somatic tissues and from one another increases the probability of mutations affecting both male and female PGCs of a given individual. We speculate that this suite of features, combined with a capacity for self-fertilization, may contribute to the dramatically rearranged genome of Helobdella robusta relative to other animals.},

The diversity of transcription factors and signalling pathway genes in animals with a limited number of cell types and a restricted developmental repertoire is puzzling, particularly in light of claims that such highly conserved elements among bilaterians provide evidence of a morphologically complex protostome-deuterostome ancestor. Here, I explore the early origination of elements of what became the bilaterian toolkit, and suggest that placozoans and cnidarians represent a depauperate residue of a once more diverse assemblage of early animals, some of which may be represented in the Ediacaran fauna (c. 585-542 Myr ago).},

Although bloodfeeding in leeches has long been of interest to biologists and medical practitioners alike, only a few studies have comprehensively examined the anticoagulant repertoires of hematophagous leeches, and these have largely been confined to representatives of Glossiphoniidae, Hirudinidae, and Macrobdellidae. Here, we present 454 pyrosequencing data from the salivary transcriptome of the hematophagous terrestrial leech Haemadipsa interrupta (Haemadipsidae). Assembled transcripts were annotated using both similarity scores (BLAST) and gene ontology (Blast2GO). Subsequently, transcripts were examined within alignments containing well-characterized anticoagulants and other select bioactive (i.e., affecting the living cells of the prey) salivary proteins and phylogenies were reconstructed for each protein data set to verify orthology predictions. In total, transcripts significantly matching 20 salivary proteins of interest were found in the transcriptome, representing several different antagonistic pathways. After reviewing gene ontologies, alignments, and phylogenetic trees, sequences for 15 out of the 20 hits were deemed correctly annotated. Additionally, we recovered matches against several proteins that have previously been linked to anticoagulation (e.g., cathepsin and disintegrins), but the specific function of which in leeches needs further investigation. Finally, in light of these data as well as those previously published, we discuss our current understanding of the distribution and evolution of anticoagulants in leeches.},

Previous experiments suggested cyclic reproduction to be controlled by corresponding changes in the inhibitory endocrine activity of the proventriculus. The evidence, however, indicates that the prostomium rather than the proventriculus is the primary source of control of reproductive periodicity. The prostomium of a summer male undergoes a spontaneous lunar cycle of hormonal activity. Hormone secretion occurs around day 13 after previous stolon release each time. The hormone probably operates a triggering mechanism that shifts worms from the postreproductive regeneration phase to the next stolonization phase. However, the action on peripheral targets may be indirectly via the proventricular system, the inhibitory activity of which probably becomes inactivated periodically under endocrine influence of the prostomium. Considering all the information available, a model of the cooperation of environmental factors and endocrine factors (prostomial and proventricular hormone) in the timing of the reproductive cycle in male T. prolifera is presented.},

However, the data used for the latter studies came from various sources and technologies, involved poorly-occupied matrices and lacked key lineages. Here we generated a new Illumina-based dataset to address annelid relationships from a fresh perspective, independent from previously generated data and with nearly fully-occupied matrices. Our sampling reflects the span of annelid diversity, including two symbiotic annelid groups (Myzostomida and Spinther) and five meiofaunal groups once referred to as part of Archiannelida (three from Protodrilida, plus Dinophilus and Polygordius). As well as the placement of these unusual annelids, we sought to address the overall phylogeny of Annelida, and provide a new perspective for naming of major clades. Our results largely corroborate the phylogenomic results of Weigert et al. (2014), with “Magelona + Owenia” and Chaetopteridae forming a grade with respect to all other annelids. Echiura and Sipuncula are supported as being annelid groups, with Sipuncula closest to amphinomids as sister group to Sedentaria and Errantia. We recovered the three Protodrilida terminals as sister clade to Phyllodocida and Eunicida (= clade Aciculata). We therefore place Protodrilida as part of Errantia. Polygordius was found to be sister group to the scaleworm terminal and the possibility that it is a simplified scaleworm clade, as has been shown for the former family Pisionidae, is discussed. Our results were equivocal with respect to Dinophilus, Myzostomida and Spinther possibly owing to confounding long-branch effects.},

Given that the N termini of mammalian STATs are known to have positive functions in transcriptional activation, we explored the role of DeltaNSTAT92E early in embryogenesis. By increasing the DeltaNSTAT92E-to-STAT92E ratio in overexpression and RNAi experiments, we observe phenotypes compatible with suppression of wild-type STAT92E activity.

To delineate the origin and formation of both of these stem cells, we isolated two vasa-related genes (Ej-vlg1 and Ej-vlg2) and analyzed the expression of each along with that of germline marker gene Ej-piwi. In adults, Ej-vlg1 and Ej-vlg2 were expressed in Ej-piwi+ germline stem cells and germ cells in gonads, while only Ej-vlg2 mRNAs were detected in neoblasts. Expression analysis during embryogenesis indicated that clusters of Ej-vlg1+/Ej-vlg2+ cells, located at the posterior ventral region in late embryos, became Ej-vlg1+/Ej-vlg2+/Ej-piwi+ germline stem cells just after embryogenesis. On the other hand, Ej-vlg2 single positive cells with morphological characteristics of neoblasts became detectable much later after embryogenesis at the ventral position on each septum where adult neoblasts exist, although these early detected cells were much smaller in size than adult neoblasts. The present results suggest that (1) germline stem cells specified just after embryogenesis are derived from Ej-vlg1+/Ej-vlg2+ cells which appear at the posterior ventral region in late embryos, and that (2) neoblasts appear much later in development. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Comparative developmental studies from the segmented phyla, arthropods and chordates, has led to speculation that mechanistic coupling of posterior growth and segmentation is an ancient character of bilaterian trunk development. However, many phyla are characterized by animals with long unsegmented trunks. Currently, there are no functional studies that have investigated the mechanistic basis of trunk elongation in these phyla, which is crucial for making firm conclusions about the relationship of conserved regulatory networks and ancestral trunk morphological organization. Our results, together with results from protostomes, challenge hypotheses suggesting that the ancestral bilaterian trunk must have been segmented and highlight the flexibility of developmental programs in organismal evolution.The trunk is a key feature of the bilaterian body plan. Despite spectacular morphological diversity in bilaterian trunk anatomies, most insights into trunk development are from segmented taxa, namely arthropods and chordates. Mechanisms of posterior axis elongation (PAE) and segmentation are tightly coupled in arthropods and vertebrates, making it challenging to differentiate between the underlying developmental mechanisms specific to each process. Investigating trunk elongation in unsegmented animals facilitates examination of mechanisms specific to PAE and provides a different perspective for testing hypotheses of bilaterian trunk evolution. Here we investigate the developmental roles of canonical Wnt and Notch signaling in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii and reveal that both pathways play key roles in PAE immediately following the completion of gastrulation. Furthermore, our functional analysis of the role of Brachyury is supportive of a Wnt-Brachyury feedback loop during PAE in S. kowalevskii, establishing this key regulatory interaction as an ancestral feature of deuterostomes. Together, our results provide valuable data for testing hypotheses of bilaterian trunk evolution.},

After amputation, new animals regenerate from each individual piece of tissue, leading Dalyell to describe them as “immortal under the edge of the knife” in 1814. Planarians also continuously renew their tissues and adapt their size in accordance with nutritional supply. This amazing plasticity relies on the presence of a population of adult pluripotent stem cell, the neoblasts. However, little is known about the mechanisms that trigger cell responses, such as cell death and division, which are required to regenerate and maintain tissues and organs in response to injury or nutritional challenge. Here, we show that JNK acts as a hub in the coordination of these events. Specifically in response to tissue loss, JNK modulates the expression of wound-related genes, induces the elimination of unnecessary cells by apoptotic cell death and controls cell division in neoblasts. Loss of JNK function results in the deregulation of these processes and prevents regeneration. Moreover, we demonstrate that JNK-dependent apoptosis is crucial to generate proportioned organisms during tissue turnover. Our findings reveal a central mechanism in planarians that senses tissue loss and translates this information into cellular responses leading to regeneration and tissue renewal.},

	annote = {Esolonización en Syllis ramosaLa sorprendente conexión del cuerpo en este animal, reportada por primera vez por Mcintosh (1885), todavía se cita como un caso extremo de gemación en los Anélidos. Según mis observaciones, esta conexión no tiene una relación causal directa con la formación del estolón que estamos tratando aquí ahora y debe considerarse, por su naturaleza, como un fenómeno teratológico. Si queremos buscar una comparación entre otros animales, esta conexión sería equivalente a la del brazo de algunos Ofiuridos. Solo una diferencia entre estos dos casos es que, en el caso de Syllid, cada rama tiene el poder de formar un individuo, es decir, un estolón.Mclntosh describe el estado o estolón unido a una rama de la siguiente manera: "Un pedículo de cuatro segmentos estrechos intervino entre la cabeza del estolón y el punto de unión del estolón al cuerpo". Y en los primeros tres segmentos del pedículo no vemos tentáculos ni parapodia, pero es seguro que son independientes entre sí cuando observamos otras estructuras (ver Fig. 11, Fig. 33). Que yo sepa, este animal vive parasitariamente en una esponja silícea, Crateromorpha meyeri, que se encuentra en las profundidades del mar de Sagami y exhibe estolonización en verano. En la estolonización, los individuos no se elevan sucesivamente entre sí en el mismo lugar, como en el caso de los tripanosilos gemíparos, sino que se forman al mismo tiempo en gran número en las ramas, a razón de un estolón por rama. En consecuencia, es dudoso que exista entre el estolón y la rama, según lo descrito por Mcintosh, un pedículo compuesto por segmentos pequeños e incompletos que no tienen tentáculos ni parapodia. El número de segmentos entre el punto de ramificación y el estolón no siempre es constante, y se puede decir que una cabeza de estolón aparece más allá del número de segmentos que son suficientes para formar la longitud completa del estolón. El extremo posterior de cada rama. Cuando miramos cada una de estas ramas por separado, la estolonización de Syllis ramosa no es más que una simple esquizogamia. Por otro lado, al comparar este pedículo observado por Mc Intosh con el pedículo no segmentado que apareció entre el estolón y la cepa de Trypanosyllis gemmipara (ver Johnston 1902, 314), se encuentra que existe no tienen relación de estructura y origen. En cuanto al grado de desarrollo de la cabeza del estolón, es solo un tipo Tetraglene sin apéndices, excepto por la apariencia de un par de ojos bien desarrollados, como lo observó Mclntosh. El estolón hembra llena casi todos los segmentos de huevos; Cada segmento está hinchado. El macho tiene el mismo desarrollo de la cabeza que la hembra, pero la diferenciación de sus segmentos de segregación avanza un paso más que el otro: hay una notable metamorfosis de los parapodos en las aletas y el desarrollo de cerdas de natación. extendido. La producción de esperma se limita a los primeros ocho segmentos y los elementos sexuales faltan en el otro posterior (Fig. 2, pl, XXIII.). Tal diferenciación de los segmentos de estolones nunca se observa en ninguna otra especie de la subfamilia Syllinae. Desde este punto de vista, el estolón macho del Syllis ramosa tiene una estructura más avanzada que los otros Syllids en general. En los especímenes originales de Misaki, el estolón macho generalmente tiene una longitud de 6 mm. aproximadamente y se compone de 27 a 28 segmentos.Al examinar en detalle el modo de ramificación de Syllis ramosa, encontramos dos casos: en uno, la rama es simétrica a la derecha y a la izquierda, y en el otro se limita a un solo lado derecho o izquierdo. En cualquier caso, la fuente de una mariposa siempre está en el nivel parapodial y nunca entre dos segmentos. Es Oka (1895) quien dio explicaciones sobre este modo de conexión; Según él, la conexión es causada por dos modos muy diferentes: "incipiente incipiente" y "regenerador incipiente". Los brotes que siguen al primero son simétricos en su mayor parte y están relacionados con la aparición de un nuevo segmento entre los dos viejos: en cada lado del nivel donde deben ocurrir los parapodos y los cirros de este nuevo segmento, toman su lugar en su lugar como pequeños botones. Cuando estos brotes tienen el mismo desarrollo, forman dos ramas simétricas a la derecha y a la izquierda, y cuando se desarrollan de manera diferente entre sí, las ramas que producen ya no son simétricas, sino desiguales.En la ramificación por brotación regenerativa, el círculo dorsal degenera en un lado de los segmentos por una causa desconocida y, según mis observaciones, aparece una masa celular sobresaliente, algo opaca y distinta en lugar de este círculo, en el nivel correspondiente. en su base (Fig. 18 a, br1). Y el nuevo círculo dorsal que se reproduce a partir de esta masa en la próxima oportunidad es un poco más grande que el anterior y tiene en su extremo un par de cirros anales muy delgados (Fig. 18 br2). Los parapodios en el fondo del brote regenerativo se degeneran gradualmente con el desarrollo del mismo y eventualmente desaparecen por completo. En la siguiente fase de su desarrollo, obsesionados con muchos especímenes, todos los brotes regenerativos alargados y segmentados; Por lo tanto, tenían una forma suficientemente desarrollada como una rama independiente y tenían una extensión del canal alimentario de la cepa (Fig. 18c-d).En resumen, los dos modos de gemación en cuestión difieren entre sí solo en la época de la producción de yemas, y en ambos casos la yema también puede considerarse como una transformación del círculo dorsal. En la gemación intercalar, el parapod carece desde el principio, mientras que en la gemación regenerativa, se absorbe gradualmente y se reduce a nada con la extensión de la yema regeneradora. ¿Por qué no ocurre el parapode en el primer caso? En los poliquetos, al menos entre los silidianos, la formación del parapod es siempre más retardada que la del círculo dorsal; por lo tanto, parece que cuando los brotes laterales ocurren en lugar de los cirros dorsales; El fenómeno de la degeneración de los parapodia que sigue a esta producción está incluido en su incapacidad para aparecer.Con respecto a la causa del brote, Brunel y Schoener (1904) dicen que proviene de una herida causada por una aguja aguda de la esponja silícea donde el gusano vive parasitariamente. Pero entonces, ¿por qué dos modos de gemación son causados ​​por el mismo trauma? Podría atribuir la causa a la importancia de la herida y asumir, por ejemplo, la gemación intercalar en el caso de que llegue al canal alimentario y la regeneración en el caso de que la que se da en las paredes del cuerpo se desnude solo el cirre dorsal? La ramificación lateral puede ser causada por un trauma, como Oka encontró en una muestra que se muestra en la Figura 4: descubrió que una herida dada a la cola de un brote en desarrollo resultó en la formación de un par de ramas paralelas Sin embargo, no es seguro que la separación de los estolones o la amputación del cuerpo causada por otras causas sea siempre el factor de conexión. Parece que la regeneración después de la separación de los estolones produce cola para la mayoría de los casos. Pero el nivel de apariencia de los brotes en regeneración, a diferencia de nuestros experimentos, está en este caso en el extremo posterior por encima del canal alimentario. Estos brotes se forman generalmente debajo de lo que está en contacto con el nervio. Este hecho parece estar relacionado con el hecho de que la conexión tiene lugar en la base del círculo dorsal, y se provoca, al menos al principio, sin ninguna relación directa con la cadena nerviosa ventral.},

	abstract = {Amblyosyllis is a worldwide distributed group of annelids mainly found in coastal environments. It is well known among the polychaete specialists mostly because of its notable beauty, showing bright colourful patterns and outstanding long and coiled appendices. Amblyosyllis is a monophyletic genus easy to identify due to its distinct diagnostic features; however, the species and their boundaries are, in most cases, not well defined. Herein, we provide an extensive sample of Amblyosyllis material (115 specimens) from several world geographic areas. We have studied the morphological features of each specimen and photographed them alive. Two mitochondrial DNA markers (COI and 16S) and one nuclear gene fragment (28S, D1 region) were sequenced. We performed phylogenetic analyses based on each DNA partition, as well as the combined data sets, obtaining congruent results. Species delimitation methods such as distance analyses, statistical parsimony networks and multi-rate Poisson tree processes were also applied. The combined results obtained from different methodologies and data sets are used to differentiate between, at least, 19 lineages compatible with the separately evolving meta-populations species concept. Four of these lineages are identified as nominal species, including the type species of Amblyosyllis, A. rhombeata. For three other lineages previously synonymized names are recovered, and seven lineages are described as new species. All of these species are described and supported by appropriate iconography. We recognize several morphological characters useful to identify species of Amblyosyllis, which in some cases should also be combined with molecular methods for species delineation. The genetic divergence in the genus is high, contrary to the morphological homogeneity observed. Two species show a wide geographical distribution, while the rest have a more restricted distribution. There are several examples of species with overlapping distribution patterns.},

Here we explore the function of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced through lesions in adult zebrafish. We show that ROS production, following adult fin amputation, is tightly regulated in time and space for at least 24 hours, whereas ROS production remains transient (2 hours) in mere wound healing. In regenerative tissue, ROS signaling triggers two distinct parallel pathways: one pathway is responsible for apoptosis, and the other pathway is responsible for JNK activation. Both events are involved in the compensatory proliferation of stump epidermal cells and are necessary for the progression of regeneration. Both events impact the Wnt, SDF1 and IGF pathways, while apoptosis only impacts progenitor marker expression. These results implicate oxidative stress in regeneration and provide new insights into the differences between healing and regeneration.},

The newest addition in MEGA5 is a collection of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for inferring evolutionary trees, selecting best-fit substitution models (nucleotide or amino acid), inferring ancestral states and sequences (along with probabilities), and estimating evolutionary rates site-by-site. In computer simulation analyses, ML tree inference algorithms in MEGA5 compared favorably with other software packages in terms of computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimates of phylogenetic trees, substitution parameters, and rate variation among sites. The MEGA user interface has now been enhanced to be activity driven to make it easier for the use of both beginners and experienced scientists. This version of MEGA is intended for the Windows platform, and it has been configured for effective use on Mac OS X and Linux desktops.

	abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or “transition” type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimidine, the difference is called type II (or “transversion” type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = — (1/2) ln \{(1 — 2P — Q) \}. The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the synonymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is estimated by K'S = — (1/2) ln (1 — 2P — Q). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin sequences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution.},

The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian Cladolabes schmeltzii, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances achieved by application of high-performance computing methods and novel algorithmic techniques to maximum likelihood (ML)-based inference programs, the major computational bottleneck still consists in the computation of bootstrap support values. Conducting a probably insufficient number of 100 bootstrap (BS) analyses with current ML programs on large datasets-either with respect to the number of taxa or base pairs-can easily require a month of run time. Therefore, we have developed, implemented, and thoroughly tested rapid bootstrap heuristics in RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) that are more than an order of magnitude faster than current algorithms. These new heuristics can contribute to resolving the computational bottleneck and improve current methodology in phylogenetic analyses. Computational experiments to assess the performance and relative accuracy of these heuristics were conducted on 22 diverse DNA and AA (amino acid), single gene as well as multigene, real-world alignments containing 125 up to 7764 sequences. The standard BS (SBS) and rapid BS (RBS) values drawn on the best-scoring ML tree are highly correlated and show almost identical average support values. The weighted RF (Robinson-Foulds) distance between SBS- and RBS-based consensus trees was smaller than 6\% in all cases (average 4\%). More importantly, RBS inferences are between 8 and 20 times faster (average 14.73) than SBS analyses with RAxML and between 18 and 495 times faster than BS analyses with competing programs, such as PHYML or GARLI. Moreover, this performance improvement increases with alignment size. Finally, we have set up two freely accessible Web servers for this significantly improved version of RAxML that provide access to the 200-CPU cluster of the Vital-IT unit at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the 128-CPU cluster of the CIPRES project at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. These Web servers offer the possibility to conduct large-scale phylogenetic inferences to a large part of the community that does not have access to, or the expertise to use, high-performance computing resources.},

Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets {\textbackslash}textgreater or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively. AVAILABILITY: icwww.epfl.ch/∼stamatak},

The expression of xGS mRNA in the nervous system continues until the larval stages, but declines thereafter and becomes undetectable in adult brain.

Here we report a novel type of luciferase gene from the Japanese fireworm O. undecimdonta. The major SDS-PAGE band of the luminous mucus showed luciferase activity. A highly sensitive mass spectrometry analysis in combination with RNA sequencing technique revealed that this band was product of a single gene with no homology to any other sequences in public databases. The recombinant protein of this putative luciferase gene expressed in mammalian cells produced the same unique bluish-green emission peak as the fireworm crude extract, indicating that this novel gene is the genuine fireworm luciferase with an evolutionary different origin from other luciferases previously described.

	abstract = {Regeneration is an essential process for all multicellular organisms, allowing them to recover effectively from internal and external injury. This process has been studied extensively in a medical context in vertebrates, with pathways often investigated mechanistically, both to derive increased understanding and as potential drug targets for therapy. Several species from other parts of the metazoan tree of life, including Hydra, planarians and echinoderms, noted for their regenerative capabilities, have previously been targeted for study. Less well-documented for their regenerative abilities are sponges. This is surprising, as they are both one of the earliest-branching extant metazoan phyla on Earth, and are rapidly able to respond to injury. Their sessile lifestyle, lack of an external protective layer, inability to respond to predation and filter-feeding strategy all mean that regeneration is often required. In particular the demosponge genus Halisarca has been noted for its fast cell turnover and ability to quickly adjust its cell kinetic properties to repair damage through regeneration. However, while the rate and structure of regeneration in sponges has begun to be investigated, the molecular mechanisms behind this ability are yet to be catalogued. Here we describe the assembly of a reference transcriptome for Halisarca caerulea, along with additional transcriptomes noting response to injury before, shortly following (2 h post-), and 12 h after trauma. RNAseq reads were assembled using Trinity, annotated, and samples compared, to allow initial insight into the transcriptomic basis of sponge regenerative processes. These resources are deep, with our reference assembly containing {\textbackslash}textgreater 92.6\% of the BUSCO Metazoa set of genes, and well-assembled (N50s of 836, 957, 1688 and 2032 for untreated, 2 h, 12 h and reference transcriptomes respectively), and therefore represent excellent qualitative resources as a bedrock for future study. The generation of transcriptomic resources from sponges before and following deliberate damage has allowed us to study particular pathways within this species responsible for repairing damage. We note particularly the involvement of the Wnt cascades in this process in this species, and detail the contents of this cascade, along with cell cycle, extracellular matrix and apoptosis-linked genes in this work. This resource represents an initial starting point for the continued development of this knowledge, given H. caerulea's ability to regenerate and position as an outgroup for comparing the process of regeneration across metazoan lineages. With this resource in place, we can begin to infer the regenerative capacity of the common ancestor of all extant animal life, and unravel the elements of regeneration in an often-overlooked clade.},

The evolution of developmental mechanisms is less studied in the Lophotrochozoa than in the other two clades. We have studied the expression of Hox genes during larval development of two lophotrochozoans, the polychaete annelids Nereis virens and Platynereis dumerilii. As reported previously, the Hox cluster of N. virens consists of at least 11 genes (de Rosa R, Grenier JK, Andreeva T, Cook CE, Adoutte A, Akam M, Carroll SB, Balavoine G, Nature, 399:772-776, 1999; Andreeva TF, Cook C, Korchagina NM, Akam M, Dondua AK, Ontogenez 32:225-233, 2001); we have also cloned nine Hox genes of P. dumerilii. Hox genes are mainly expressed in the descendants of the 2d blastomere, which form the integument of segments, ventral neural ganglia, pre-pygidial growth zone, and the pygidial lobe. Patterns of expression are similar for orthologous genes of both nereids. In Nereis, Hox2, and Hox3 are activated before the blastopore closure, while Hox1 and Hox4 are activated just after this. Hox5 and Post2 are first active during the metatrochophore stage, and Hox7, Lox4, and Lox2 at the late nectochaete stage only. During larval stages, Hox genes are expressed in staggered domains in the developing segments and pygidial lobe. The pattern of expression of Hox cluster genes suggests their involvement in the vectorial regionalization of the larval body along the antero-posterior axis. Hox gene expression in nereids conforms to the canonical patterns postulated for the two other evolutionary branches of the Bilateria, the Ecdysozoa and the Deuterostomia, thus supporting the evolutionary conservatism of the function of Hox genes in development.},

Here we show that in the CNS of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are located close to the ventral midline and express axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we observe that Wnt/β-catenin is required for the transition between proliferating NPCs and differentiating neurons. We also show that the Rho-associated kinase (Rok) is necessary for neurectoderm morphogenesis and ventral midline formation, and indirectly affects the distribution of the NPCs and the development of axonal scaffolds. Moreover, seven genes belonging to the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway are expressed in the developing Platynereis neurectoderm, suggesting an involvement in its morphogenesis. When compared with previous studies in vertebrates, our data suggest that the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the control of neural cell proliferation/differentiation is ancestral to bilaterians.},

	abstract = {Human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) features subregion-specific hippocampal neurodegeneration and reactive astrogliosis, including up-regulation of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and down-regulation of glutamine synthetase (GS). However, the regional astrocytic expression pattern of GFAP and GS upon MTLE-associated neurodegeneration still remains elusive. We assessed GFAP and GS expression in strict correlation with the local neuronal number in cortical and hippocampal surgical specimens from 16 MTLE patients using immunohistochemistry, stereology and high-resolution image analysis for digital pathology and whole-slide imaging. In the cortex, GS-positive (GS+) astrocytes are dominant in all neuronal layers, with a neuron to GS+ cell ratio of 2:1. GFAP-positive (GFAP+) cells are widely spaced, with a GS+ to GFAP+ cell ratio of 3:1–5:1. White matter astrocytes, on the contrary, express mainly GFAP and, to a lesser extent, GS. In the hippocampus, the neuron to GS+ cell ratio is approximately 1:1. Hippocampal degeneration is associated with a reduction of GS+ astrocytes, which is proportional to the degree of neuronal loss and primarily present in the hilus. Up-regulation of GFAP as a classical hallmark of reactive astrogliosis does not follow the GS-pattern and is prominent in the CA1. Reactive alterations were proportional to the neuronal loss in the neuronal somatic layers (stratum pyramidale and hilus), while observed to a lesser extent in the axonal/dendritic layers (stratum radiatum, molecular layer). We conclude that astrocytic GS is expressed in the neuronal somatic layers and, upon neurodegeneration, is down-regulated proportionally to the degree of neuronal loss.},

Cnidarians (e.g. sea anemones, corals and hydroids) are the sister group to the Bilateria and possess genes related to both anterior and central/posterior class Hox genes. In the absence of a conserved set of Hox genes among other early branching animal clades, cnidarians provide the best opportunity to learn about the emergence of this gene family. We report a previously unrecognized domain of Hox expression in the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, beginning at early blastula stages. Functional perturbation reveals that two Hox genes not only regulate their respective expression domains, but interact with one another to pattern the entire oral-aboral axis mediated by Wnt signaling. This suggests an ancient link between Hox/Wnt patterning of the oral-aboral axis and suggest that these domains are likely established during blastula formation in anthozoan cnidarians.},

Here, we followed the germline throughout the life cycle of the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii, by examining mRNA and protein expression of vasa and other germline-specific factors in combination with lineage tracing experiments. In the fertilised egg, maternal Vasa protein localises to the yolk-free cytoplasm at the animal pole. It then asymmetrically segregates first into the micromeres, then into the founder cells of the mesodermal posterior growth zone (MPGZ). Vasa transcripts initially show ubiquitous distribution, but then become progressively restricted to the MPGZ. The cells of the MPGZ are highly proliferative, as evidenced by BrdU pulse labelling experiments. Besides vasa, they express nanos along with the stem cell-specific genes piwi, and PL10. At 4 days of development, four primordial germ cells are singled out from within the MPGZ, and migrate into the anterior segments to colonise a newly discovered 'primary gonad'. Our data suggest a common origin of germ cells and of somatic stem cells, similar to the situation found in planarians and cnidarians, which may constitute the ancestral mode of germ cell specification in Metazoa. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Using the well-characterized luciferase gene of the Japanese syllid Odontosyllis undecimdonta as a reference, a complete best-matching luciferase open reading frame (329 amino acids in length) was found in all three individuals analyzed in addition to numerous other paralogous sequences in this new gene family. No photoproteins were detected. We also recovered a predicted homolog of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (268 amino acids in length) that best matched luciferase of the firefly Luciola with the best predicted template being the crystal structure of luciferase for Photinus pyralis, the common eastern firefly. A wide variety of genes associated with periodicity were recovered including predicted homologs of clock, bmal1, period, and timeless. Several genes corresponding to putative epitoky-related changes of the eyes were recovered including predicted homologs of a phototransduction gene, a retinol dehydrogenase and carotenoid isomerooxygenase as well as a visual perception related retinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase. Genes correlating to putative epitoky-related changes of the nephridia included predicted homologs of nephrocystin-3 and an egg-release sex peptide receptor.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-797},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Planarians can regenerate entire animals from a small fragment of the body. The regenerating fragment is able to create new tissues and remodel existing tissues to form a complete animal. Thus different fragments with very different starting components eventually converge on the same solution. In this study, we performed an extensive RNA-seq time-course on regenerating head and tail fragments to observe the differences and similarities of the transcriptional landscape between head and tail fragments during regeneration. RESULTS: We have consolidated existing transcriptomic data for S. mediterranea to generate a high confidence set of transcripts for use in genome wide expression studies. We performed a RNA-seq time-course on regenerating head and tail fragments from 0 hours to 3 days. We found that the transcriptome profiles of head and tail regeneration were very different at the start of regeneration; however, an unexpected convergence of transcriptional profiles occurred at 48 hours when head and tail fragments are still morphologically distinct. By comparing differentially expressed transcripts at various time-points, we revealed that this divergence/convergence pattern is caused by a shared regulatory program that runs early in heads and later in tails.Additionally, we also performed RNA-seq on smed-prep(RNAi) tail fragments which ultimately fail to regenerate anterior structures. We find the gene regulation program in response to smed-prep(RNAi) to display the opposite regulatory trend compared to the previously mentioned share regulatory program during regeneration. Using annotation data and comparative approaches, we also identified a set of approximately 4,800 triclad specific transcripts that were enriched amongst the genes displaying differential expression during the regeneration time-course. CONCLUSION: The regeneration transcriptome of head and tail regeneration provides us with a rich resource for investigating the global expression changes that occurs during regeneration. We show that very different regenerative scenarios utilize a shared core regenerative program. Furthermore, our consolidated transcriptome and annotations allowed us to identity triclad specific transcripts that are enriched within this core regulatory program. Our data support the hypothesis that both conserved aspects of animal developmental programs and recent evolutionarily innovations work in concert to control regeneration.},

It has even been proposed that the bilaterian ancestor resembled an annelid. However, a robust phylogeny of Annelida, especially with respect to the basal relationships, has been lacking. Our study based on transcriptomic data comprising 68,750-170,497 amino acid sites from 305 to 622 proteins resolves annelid relationships, including Chaetopteridae, Amphinomidae, Sipuncula, Oweniidae, and Magelonidae in the basal part of the tree. Myzostomida, which have been indicated to belong to the basal radiation as well, are now found deeply nested within Annelida as sister group to Errantia in most analyses. On the basis of our reconstruction of a robust annelid phylogeny, we show that the basal branching taxa include a huge variety of life styles such as tube dwelling and deposit feeding, endobenthic and burrowing, tubicolous and filter feeding, and errant and carnivorous forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction suggests that the ancestral annelid possessed a pair of either sensory or grooved palps, bicellular eyes, biramous parapodia bearing simple chaeta, and lacked nuchal organs. Because the oldest fossil of Annelida is reported for Sipuncula (520 Ma), we infer that the early diversification of annelids took place at least in the Lower Cambrian.},

In growing worms, the expression of EjTuba in the head and mino in the trunk region just posterior to the head were observed in defined body segments, while the expression areas of EjTuba in the trunk and horu were proportional to the total number of body segments. In the regeneration process, expression of these genes disappeared once and recovered to their original pattern by day 7. In abnormal regeneration such as a bipolar head, mino was still expressed in the region next to both the normal and the ectopic heads. These results suggest that there is morphallactic as well as epimorphic or inductive regulation of the body patterning during regeneration of E. japonensis.},

	url = {http://www.pnas.org/content/106/52/22329.abstract},
	abstract = {Despite long-standing interest, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of anterior–posterior (AP) polarity remain among the unsolved mysteries in metazoans. In the planarians (a family of flatworms), canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for posterior specification, as it is in many animals. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the posterior-specific induction of Wnt genes according to the AP polarity have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is responsible for the establishment of AP polarity via its regulation of the transcription of Wnt family genes during planarian regeneration. We found that RNAi gene knockdown of Dugesia japonica patched (Djptc) caused ectopic tail formation in the anterior blastema of body fragments, resulting in bipolar-tails regeneration. In contrast, RNAi of hedgehog (Djhh) and gli (Djgli) caused bipolar-heads regeneration. We show that Patched-mediated Hh signaling was crucial for posterior specification, which is established by regulating the transcription of Wnt genes via downstream Gli activity. Moreover, differentiated cells were responsible for the posterior specification of undifferentiated stem cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Surprisingly, Djhh was expressed in neural cells all along the ventral nerve cords (along the AP axis), but not in the posterior blastema of body fragments, where the expression of Wnt genes was induced for posteriorization. We therefore propose that Hh signals direct head or tail regeneration according to the AP polarity, which is established by Hh signaling activity along the body\&\#039;s preexisting nervous system.},

	abstract = {Notch is a key signalling pathway playing multiple and varied functions during development. Notch regulates the selection of cells with a neurogenic fate and maintains a pool of yet uncommitted precursors through lateral inhibition, both in insects and in vertebrates. Here, we explore the functions of Notch in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii (Lophotrochozoa). Conserved components of the pathway are identified and a scenario for their evolution in metazoans is proposed. Unexpectedly, neither Notch nor its ligands are expressed in the neurogenic epithelia of the larva at the time when massive neurogenesis begins. Using chemical inhibitors and neural markers, we demonstrate that Notch plays no major role in the general neurogenesis of larvae. Instead, we find Notch components expressed in nascent chaetal sacs, the organs that produce the annelid bristles. Impairing Notch signalling induces defects in chaetal sac formation, abnormalities in chaetae producing cells and a change of identity of chaeta growth accessory cells. This is the first bilaterian species in which the early neurogenesis processes appear to occur without a major involvement of the Notch pathway. Instead, Notch is co-opted to pattern annelid-specific organs, likely through a lateral inhibition process. These features reinforce the view that Notch signalling has been recruited multiple times in evolution due to its remarkable ‘toolkit' nature.},

	abstract = {Regeneration, the ability to restore body parts after an injury or an amputation, is a widespread but highly variable and complex phenomenon in animals. While having fascinating scientists since centuries, fundamental questions about the cellular basis of animal regeneration as well as its evolutionary history remain largely unanswered. We study regeneration of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, an emerging comparative developmental biology model, which, like many other annelids, displays important regenerative abilities. If the posterior part of the body is amputated, P. dumerilii worms are able to regenerate the posteriormost differentiated part of the body and stem cell-rich growth zone that allows to make new segments to replace amputated ones. We show that posterior regeneration is a rapid process that follows a well reproducible paths and timeline, going through specific stages that we thoroughly defined. Wound healing is achieved by one day post-amputation and a regeneration blastema forms one day later. At this time point, some tissue specification already occurs, and a functional posterior growth zone is re-established as early as three days after amputation. Regeneration is only influenced in a minor manner by worm size and position of the amputation site along the antero-posterior axis of the worm and regenerative abilities persist upon repeated amputations without important alterations of the process. We also show that intense cell proliferation occurs during regeneration and that cell divisions are strictly required for regeneration to normally proceed. Finally, we provide evidence, through several 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse and chase experiments, in favor of a local origin of the blastema, whose constituting cells mostly derive from the segment immediately abutting the amputation plane. The detailed characterization of P. dumerilii posterior body regeneration presented in this article provides the foundation for future mechanistic and comparative studies of regeneration in this species.},

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.3390/toxins10070292},
	abstract = {Venoms are evolutionary key adaptations that species employ for defense, predation or competition. However, the processes and forces that drive the evolution of venoms and their toxin components remain in many aspects understudied. In particular, the venoms of many smaller, neglected (mostly invertebrate) organisms are not characterized in detail, especially with modern methods. For the majority of these taxa, even their biology is only vaguely known. Modern evolutionary venomics addresses the question of how venoms evolve by applying a plethora of -omics methods. These recently became so sensitive and enhanced that smaller, neglected organisms are now more easily accessible to comparatively study their venoms. More knowledge about these taxa is essential to better understand venom evolution in general. The methodological core pillars of integrative evolutionary venomics are genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, which are complemented by functional morphology and the field of protein synthesis and activity tests. This manuscript focuses on transcriptomics (or RNASeq) as one toolbox to describe venom evolution in smaller, neglected taxa. It provides a hands-on guide that discusses a generalized RNASeq workflow, which can be adapted, accordingly, to respective projects. For neglected and small taxa, generalized recommendations are difficult to give and conclusions need to be made individually from case to case. In the context of evolutionary venomics, this overview highlights critical points, but also promises of RNASeq analyses. Methodologically, these concern the impact of read processing, possible improvements by perfoming multiple and merged assemblies, and adequate quantification of expressed transcripts. Readers are guided to reappraise their hypotheses on venom evolution in smaller organisms and how robustly these are testable with the current transcriptomics toolbox. The complementary approach that combines particular proteomics but also genomics with transcriptomics is discussed as well. As recently shown, comparative proteomics is, for example, most important in preventing false positive identifications of possible toxin transcripts. Finally, future directions in transcriptomics, such as applying 3rd generation sequencing strategies to overcome difficulties by short read assemblies, are briefly addressed.},

Here we study gene expression patterns in distantly related species to investigate conserved regeneration strategies. To this end, we collect from the literature transcriptomic data obtained during the regeneration of three species (Hydra magnipapillata, Schmidtea mediterranea, and Apostichopus japonicus), and compare them with gene expression during regeneration in vertebrates and mammals. This allows us to identify a common set of differentially expressed genes and relevant shared pathways that are conserved across species during the early stage of the regeneration process. We also find a set of differentially expressed genes that in mammals are associated to the presence of macrophages and to the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. This suggests that features of the sophisticated wound healing strategy of mammals are already observable in earlier emerging metazoans.},

Posterior-facing blastemas regenerate a head instead of a tail in Smed-βcatenin-1(RNAi) animals. Smed-βcatenin-1 is required after wounding and at any posterior-facing wound for polarity. Additionally, intact Smed-βcatenin-1(RNAi) animals display anteriorization during tissue turnover. Five Wnt genes and a secreted Frizzled-related Wnt antagonist-like gene are expressed in domains along the anteroposterior axis that reset to new positions during regeneration, which suggests that Wnts control polarity through Smed-βcatenin-1.

Piwi-like genes represent essential stem cell genes in diverse multicellular organisms. The cnidarian Piwihomolog Cniwiwas cloned from Podocoryne carnea, a hydrozoan with a full life cycle. CniwiRNA is present in all developmental stages with highest levels in the egg and the medusa. In the adult medusa, Cniwi expression is prominent in the gonads where it likely functions as a germ stem cell gene. The gene is also expressed, albeit at low levels, in differentiated somatic cells like the striated muscle of the medusa. Isolated striated muscle cells can be induced to transdifferentiate into smooth muscle cells which proliferate and differentiate into nerve cells. Cniwi expression is upregulated transiently after induction of transdifferentiation and again when the emerging smooth muscle cells proliferate and differentiate. The continuous low-level expression of an inducible stem cell gene in differentiated somatic cells may underlie the ability to form medusa buds from polyp cells and explain the extraordinary transdifferentation and regeneration potential of Podocoryne carnea.},

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive blastema formation during planarian regeneration. Here we found that treatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 blocked the entry of neoblasts into the M-phase of the cell cycle, while allowing neoblasts to successfully enter S-phase in the planarian Dugesia japonica. The rapid and efficient blockage of neoblast mitosis by treatment with the JNK inhibitor provided a method to assess whether temporally regulated cell cycle activation drives blastema formation during planarian regeneration. In the early phase of blastema formation, activated JNK was detected prominently in a mitotic region (the ?postblastema?) proximal to the blastema region. Furthermore, we demonstrated that undifferentiated mitotic neoblasts in the postblastema showed highly activated JNK at the single cell level. JNK inhibition by treatment with SP600125 during this period caused a severe defect of blastema formation, which accorded with a drastic decrease of mitotic neoblasts in regenerating animals. By contrast, these animals still retained many undifferentiated neoblasts near the amputation stump. These findings suggest that JNK signaling plays a crucial role in feeding into the blastema neoblasts for differentiation by regulating the G2/M transition in the cell cycle during planarian regeneration.},

Phylogenetic analysis shows that Smed-GSK3.1 is highly conserved compared to GSK3 sequences from other species, whereas Smed-GSK3.2 and Smed-GSK3.3 are more divergent. Treatment of regenerating planarians with 1-azakenpaullone, a synthetic GSK3 inhibitor, suggests that planarian GSK3s are essential for normal differentiation and morphogenesis of the nervous system. Cephalic ganglia appear smaller and disconnected in 1-azakenpaullone-treated animals, whereas visual axons are ectopically projected, and the pharynx does not regenerate properly. This phenotype is consistent with a role for Smed-GSK3s in neuronal polarization and axonal growth.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {During outgrowth of the developing limb, signals from the apical ectodermal ridge, such as fibroblast growth factors, are paramount for limb patterning. Similarly, fibroblast growth factor molecules and their receptors are synthesized in the wound epithelium of the regenerating limb blastema, implicating an analogous function to limb development. To address this issue further and to understand the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling in limb regeneration, we have examined the expression patterns of x-fibroblast growth factor receptors-1, -2, -3, -4a, and -4b in Xenopus laevis. This amphibian model provides a system in which both regenerating (premetamorphic; tadpole or larva stage) and nonregenerating (postmetamorphic; froglet stage) hindlimbs can be studied. In premetamorphic hindlimbs (stage 53), all of the receptors were expressed in the wound epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme. In postmetamorphic limbs (stage 61), however, transcripts for x-fibroblast growth factor receptors-1 and -2 were absent from the wound epithelium. The expression results for x-fibroblast growth factor receptors-1 and -2 were corroborated at the protein level by employing specific antibodies. Thus, it appears that expression of both fibroblast growth factor receptors-1 and -2 is associated with the ability for limb regeneration. The role of these receptors in regeneration was further investigated by using specific inhibitors to fibroblast growth factor receptors during premetamorphic hindlimb regeneration. These compounds inhibited the normal limb outgrowth and resulted, in the majority of the cases, in outgrowths of cones or spikes reminiscent of growth that is seen in amputated postmetamorphic limbs. Thus, fibroblast growth factor receptors-1 and -2 expression and function should be regarded as paramount for the ability of limb regeneration in Xenopus.},

BMP signaling was involved in the formation of new tissues at the midline of regeneration, the dorsal-ventral patterning of new tissues, and the maintenance of the dorsal-ventral pattern of existing adult tissue in homeostasis. smedbmp4-1 was normally expressed at the dorsal midline. Asymmetric fragments lacking a midline displayed new smedbmp4-1 expression prior to formation of a regenerative outgrowth (blastema). Asymmetric fragments containing the midline displayed expanded smedbmp4-1 expression towards the wound. We suggest injured animals that lack left-right symmetry reset their midline through modulation of BMP activity as an early and necessary event in regeneration.},

In our previous study, we performed complementary deoxyribonucleic acid subtraction cloning to isolate genes that are upregulated during E. japonensis regeneration and identified glutamine synthetase (gs) as one of the most abundantly expressed genes during this process. In the present study, we show that the full-length sequence of E. japonensis glutamine synthetase (EjGS), which is the first reported annelid glutamine synthetase, is highly similar to other known class II glutamine synthetases. EjGS shows a 61-71\% overall amino acid sequence identity with its counterparts in various other animal species, including Drosophila and mouse. We performed detailed expression analysis by in situ hybridization and reveal that strong gs expression occurs in the blastemal regions of regenerating E. japonensis soon after amputation. gs expression was detectable at the cell layer covering the wound and was found to persist in the epidermal cells during the formation and elongation of the blastema. Furthermore, in the elongated blastema, gs expression was detectable also in the presumptive regions of the brain, ventral nerve cord, and stomodeum. In the fully formed intact head, gs expression was also evident in the prostomium, brain, the anterior end of the ventral nerve cord, the epithelium of buccal and pharyngeal cavities, the pharyngeal pad, and in the esophageal appendages. In intact E. japonensis tails, gs expression was found in the growth zone in actively growing worms but not in full-grown individuals. In the nonblastemal regions of regenerating fragments and in intact worms, gs expression was also detected in the nephridia, chloragocytes, gut epithelium, epidermis, spermatids, and oocytes. These results suggest that EjGS may play roles in regeneration, nerve function, cell proliferation, nitrogenous waste excretion, macromolecule synthesis, and gametogenesis.},

To obtain the genomic information of blastema tissues, de novo transcriptomes from both blastema tissues and denervated stump ends of Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotls) 14 days post-amputation were sequenced and compared using Solexa DNA sequencing.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: The sequencing done for this study produced 40,688,892 reads that were assembled into 307,345 transcribed sequences. The N50 of transcribed sequence length was 562 bases. A similarity search with known proteins identified 39,200 different genes to be expressed during limb regeneration with a cut-off E-value exceeding 10-5. We annotated assembled sequences by using gene descriptions, gene ontology, and clusters of orthologous group terms. Targeted searches using these annotations showed that the majority of the genes were in the categories of essential metabolic pathways, transcription factors and conserved signaling pathways, and novel candidate genes for regenerative processes. We discovered and confirmed numerous sequences of the candidate genes by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that de novo transcriptome sequencing allows gene expression analysis in a species lacking genome information and provides the most comprehensive mRNA sequence resources for axolotls. The characterization of the axolotl transcriptome can help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying blastema formation during limb regeneration.},

Here, we provide a comparative analysis of de novo-assembled transcriptomes in two Mediterranean earthworm species with the objective to detect pheromone proteins and other reproductive genes that could be involved in cryptic speciation processes, as recently characterized in other earthworm species. cDNA libraries of unspecific tissue of Hormogaster samnitica and three different tissues of H. elisae were sequenced in an Illumina Genome Analyzer II or Hi-Seq. Two pheromones, Attractin and Temptin were detected in all tissue samples and both species. Attractin resulted in a reliable marker for phylogenetic inference. Temptin contained multiple paralogs and was slightly overexpressed in the digestive tissue, suggesting that these pheromones could be released with the casts. Genes involved in sexual determination and fertilization were highly expressed in reproductive tissue. This is thus the first detailed analysis of the molecular machinery of sexual reproduction in earthworms.},

By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments.

Syllids have striking ability to regenerate their body anteriorly and posteriorly, which in many species is redeployed during sexual (schizogamy) and asexual (fission) reproduction. This review summarizes the available data on regeneration in syllids, covering descriptions of regenerative mechanisms in different species, as well as regeneration in relation with reproductive modes. Our survey shows that posterior regeneration is widely distributed in syllids, whereas anterior regeneration is limited in most of the species, excepting those reproducing by fission. This latter reproductive mode is well known for a few species belonging to Autolytinae, Eusyllinae and Syllinae. Patterns of fission areas were studied in those animals. Deviations of the regular regeneration pattern or aberrant forms such as bifurcated animals or individuals with multiple heads have been reported for several species. Some of these aberrations show a deviation of the bilateral symmetry and antero-posterior axis, which, interestingly, can also be observed in the regular branching body pattern of some species of syllids.

Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 \%, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 \% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

	abstract = {Syllis gracilis is an emblematic member of the subfamily Syllinae (Syllidae, Annelida), which inhabits shallow, temperate coastal waters and can be found on algae, coral rubble, and sponges. Their distinctive ypsiloid chaetae, usually found in specimens from populations all around the world, led to the consideration of the species as cosmopolitan, even though four other species have similar chaetae: Syllis magellanica, S. picta, S. mayeri and S. ypsiloides. The discovery of deeply divergent lineages in the Mediterranean Sea, that were morphologically similar, questioned the cosmopolitanism of S. gracilis and suggested the possibility of it being a species complex. In order to assess the speciation patterns within the putative S. gracilis complex, we undertook species delimitation and phylogenetic analyses on 61 specimens morphologically ascribed to Syllis gracilis and closely related species using a multilocus molecular dataset (two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers). Our results suggest high levels of genetic differentiation between the S. gracilis populations analyzed, some of which have morphologically distinctive features. Five to eight distinct lineages (depending on the analysis) were identified, all with geographically restricted distributions. Although the presence of ypsiloid chaetae has been traditionally considered the main character to identify S. gracilis, we conclude that this feature is homoplastic. Instead, we propose that characters such as the degree of fusion of blades and shafts in chaetae, the morphology of the posterior chaetae or the animal color pattern should be considered to differentiate lineages within the S. gracilis species complex. Our study does not support the cosmopolitanism of S. gracilis, and instead provides morphological and molecular evidence of the existence of a complex of pseudo-cryptic species.},

The scientific production related to polychaetes is dominated by informally published material (92.3\%) and majority of the studies analyzed (75.6\%) was not specifically about the group Polychaeta, but on benthic macrofauna, with predominance of work in mangroves environments (59.6\%). A total of 99 genera, 32 families and 38 taxa was identified to the species level recorded for Maranhão. The knowledge of the polychaetous fauna is still incipient, requiring greater investment and intensification of studies.

The diversity and distribution of molluscs from the Amazon Coast of Maranhão State, Brazil, are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate how molluscs in two mangrove creeks (Buenos Aires and Tronco) at the São Marcos Bay, coast of the Maranhão State, respond to spatial and temporal variations in the environment. Sampling was performed in the intertidal area along three zones established using a straight line transect of 100 m. Abiotic variables of water and sediment were measured at each creek. We found 5,912 specimens belonging to 23 species and 15 families of epifaunal and infaunal molluscs. The patterns of their distribution in the two creeks were different. Salinity, dissolved oxygen, and rainfall were the main variables that affected the temporal distribution of molluscs. We found low species richness in the overall mollusc composition. Diversity in the Buenos Aires Creek was lower than that observed in the Tronco Creek, possibly because of activities of a port located in proximity to the former. The spatial distribution of molluscs along the zones followed an abundance and diversity gradient, mainly influenced by exposure time during low tide. Port activities may influence the patterns of mollusc distribution in the surrounding mangroves, and we thus highlight the importance of management and monitoring of these areas.},

Based on observations of live specimens, we defined five stages in the process of posterior regeneration. The morphogenesis was observed in detail by a series of sections and scanning electron microscopy. The most posterior domain of the opisthosome differentiated from the blastema, while the anterior domain of the opisthosome regenerated from the remaining trunk region.

As sexual reproduction can also be induced, it is a good model system for the study of both regenerative and germline stem cells. It has been shown by histological study that putative mesodermal stem cells called neoblasts, and dedifferentiated epidermal and endodermal cells are involved in blastema formation. Recently, we isolated three region-specific marker genes expressed in the digestive tract and showed by in situ hybridization that morphallactic as well as epimorphic regulation of the body patterning occurs during regeneration. We also cloned two vasa-related genes and analyzed their expression during development and in mature worms that undergo sexual reproduction. The results arising form these studies suggest that the origin and development of germline stem cells and neoblasts may be independent. Furthermore, we carried out functional analysis using RNA interference (RNAi) and showed that a novel gene termed grimp is required for mesodermal cell proliferation at the initial stages of regeneration. These findings indicate that the stem cell system in E. japonensis is regulated by both internal and external environmental factors.},

While the origin of new genes, gene functions, and morphological features has been studied intensely, the origin of entire developmental trajectories, such as regeneration or agametic reproduction, remains poorly understood. Agametic reproduction by fission is a novel trajectory evolved numerous times among animal phyla, including Annelida, in which it is thought to arise by co-option of regeneration. To gain insight into how a novel trajectory may evolve, we investigated a relatively recent origin of fission. We performed a detailed comparison of morphogenesis during regeneration and fission in the annelid Pristina leidyi (Clitellata, Naididae), from the onset of these trajectories to the achievement of the final morphology. We find extensive similarities between fission and regeneration morphogenesis, and, of particular note, find evidence for a synapomorphy of fission and regeneration (apparently not shared with embryogenesis) in peripheral nervous system development, providing strong support for the hypothesis that fission is derived from regeneration. We also find important differences between fission and regeneration, during development of multiple organ systems. These are manifested by temporal shifts in developmental events and by the presence of elements unique to only one process. Differences are not obviously temporally clustered at the beginning, middle, or end of development but rather occur throughout, indicating that divergence has occurred along the entire developmental course of these trajectories.},

The mechanisms underlying regeneration on this scale are currently being studied in a variety of contexts in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Regeneration generally involves the formation of a wound epithelium after transection or injury, followed by the generation of regenerative progenitor cells and morphogenesis to give the regenerate. Common mechanisms may exist in relation to each of these aspects. For example, the initial proliferation of progenitor cells often depends on the nerve supply, whereas morphogenesis reflects the generation of positional disparity between adjacent cells-the principle of intercalation. These mechanisms are reviewed here across a range of contexts.

We describe and illustrate the segmental asymmetry which intervenes between regions of symmetry, only found in branching annelids. We describe the morphology of the stolons and of the stolon stalks, which are unique to branching syllids but differ in detail from those of the other known branching syllid, Syllis ramosa . We also illustrate newly found paddle-shaped chaetae, which might indicate that these stolons do swim. We list the number of branch points and termini in an effort to gauge the extent of branching in a worm contained in a small sponge. The species appears to have separate sexes, but this cannot be proven. We compare R. multicaudata and S. ramosa as originally described and find new morphological differences between the branching syllid from Japan described as S. ramosa and R. multicaudata . We also compare the known stolons of branching syllids to those of other genera of the ‘ribbon clade', a group including Trypanobia and Trypanosyllis, now known to be close relatives of R. multicaudata. Ramisyllis multicaudata is the first member of the ribbon clade, and one of few Syllinae, known to have sexually dimorphic stolons.},

	abstract = {A family revision and cladistic analysis of the superfamily Nereidoidea sensu George and Hartmann-Schroder, 1985 (Polychaeta: Phyllodocida) based on internal and external morphological characters is presented. The superfamily, presently lacking synapomorphies, contains the Antonbruunidae, Calamyzidae, Hesionidae, Levidoridae, Nautiliniellidae, Nereididae, Pilargidae and Syllidae. Three synapomorphies are proposed: anterior or, rarely, anteroventral palps; paired pharyngeal retractor muscles; and the presence of metanephromixia. On the basis of this definition, the Chrysopetalidae are moved to the Nereidoidea. The requirement for ingroup monophyly necessitated synonymising the Antonbruunidae with the Pilargidae, and the Calamyzidae and Levidoridae with the Syllidae. The Nautiliniellidae are redefined. The cladistic analysis using 15 characters (21 apomorphic character states) and 3 outgroups (Aphroditidae, Polynoidae, and Sigalionidae) produced 3 minimum-length cladograms each with 29 steps and consistency index of 0.72. The cladograms showed the Nereidoidea to consist of 2 monophyletic groups: the Nercididae-(Chrysopetalidae-Hesionidae) and the PilargidaeNautiliniellidae-Syllidae. The topology of the latter group was variable; one cladogram had the Pilargidae as the sister-group of the Nautiliniellidae and Syllidae, and another had the Syllidae as the sister-group of the Nautiliniellidae and the Pilargidae. Evolutionary scenarios for multistate characters are given, and the phylogenetic relationships of taxa are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The naid annelids contain a number of species that vary in their ability to regenerate lost body parts, making them excellent candidates for evolution of regeneration studies. However, scant sequence data exists to facilitate such studies. We constructed a cDNA library from the naid Pristina leidyi, a species that is highly regenerative and also reproduces asexually by fission, using material from a range of regeneration and fission stages for our library. We then sequenced the transcriptome of P. leidyi using 454 technology.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: 454 sequencing produced 1,550,174 reads with an average read length of 376 nucleotides. Assembly of 454 sequence reads resulted in 64,522 isogroups and 46,679 singletons for a total of 111,201 unigenes in this transcriptome. We estimate that over 95\% of the transcripts in our library are present in our transcriptome. 17.7\% of isogroups had significant BLAST hits to the UniProt database and these include putative homologs of a number of genes relevant to regeneration research. Although many sequences are incomplete, the mean sequence length of transcripts (isotigs) is 707 nucleotides. Thus, many sequences are large enough to be immediately useful for downstream applications such as gene expression analyses. Using in situ hybridization, we show that two Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes (homologs of frizzled and β-catenin) present in our transcriptome are expressed in the regeneration blastema of P. leidyi, demonstrating the usefulness of this resource for regeneration research.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: 454 sequencing is a rapid and efficient approach for identifying large numbers of genes in an organism that lacks a sequenced genome. This transcriptome dataset will be a valuable resource for molecular analyses of regeneration in P. leidyi and will serve as a starting point for comparisons to non-regenerating naids. It also contributes significantly to the still limited genomic resources available for annelids and lophotrochozoans more generally.},

Two hundred seventy-nine of these clones were sequenced and found to contain 165 different sequences (79 known and 86 unknown). Nine clones were fully sequenced and four of these sequences were matched to known genes for glutamine synthetase, glucosidase 1, retinal protein 4, and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, respectively. The remaining five clones encoded an unknown open-reading frame. The expression levels of these genes were highest during blastema formation.

	abstract = {The origin of animal segmentation, the periodic repetition of anatomical structures along the anteroposterior axis, is a long-standing issue [1] that has been recently revived by comparative developmental genetics [2-6]. In particular, a similar extensive morphological segmentation (or metamerism) is commonly recognized in annelids and arthropods. Mostly based on this supposedly homologous segmentation, these phyla have been united for a long time into the clade Articulata [7, 8]. However, recent phylogenetic analysis [9-10] dismissed the Articulata and thus challenged the segmentation homology hypothesis [11]. Here, we report the expression patterns of genes orthologous to the arthropod segmentation genes engrailed and wingless in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. In Platynereis, engrailed and wingless are expressed in continuous ectodermal stripes on either side of the segmental boundary before, during, and after its formation; this expression pattern suggests that these genes are involved in segment formation. The striking similarities of engrailed and wingless expressions in Platynereis and arthropods may be due to evolutionary convergence or common heritage. In agreement with similarities in segment ontogeny and morphological organization in arthropods and annelids, we interpret our results as molecular evidence of a segmented ancestor of protostomes.},

	abstract = {Enchytraeus japonensis is a small terrestrial oligochaete which primarily reproduces asexually by fragmentation and regeneration. In order to introduce a molecular approach to the study of regeneration we developed a whole-mount immunostaining procedure for the worm. Using an antibody directed against acetylated tubulin in conjunction with confocal laser-scanning microscopy, we succeeded in clarifying the three- dimensional structure of the entire nervous system in the full-grown worm and its dynamics during the fragmentation and regeneration process. In addition, we examined the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the worm using a fluorescently-labeled antagonist and various antibodies. In particular, we found two circumferential structures in the body wall muscle of each segment that react strongly with alpha-bungarotoxin, an antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and detected nerve fibers just underneath these structures. During the fragmentation process, the circular body wall muscles contract near one of these circumferential structures in the middle of the segment, which causes constriction and results in fission of the body. This alpha-bungarotoxin-positive structure was designated the neuromuscular junction of the circular muscle. During the regeneration process nerve fibers grow from the remaining ventral nerve cord and gradually form networks in both the anterior and posterior regeneration buds. The growing fibers extend to the prostomium (a sensory organ) at the anterior end prior to connecting to the presumptive brain rudiment. A neural network appears around the pygidium, and this is followed by growth of the body at the posterior end. The nervous system appears to play an important role in both anterior and posterior regeneration.},

	abstract = {Background: The structure and development of the nervous system in Lophotrochozoa has long been recognized as one of the most important subjects for phylogenetic and evolutionary discussion. Many recent papers have presented comprehensive data on the structure and development of catecholaminergic, serotonergic and FMRFamidergic parts of the nervous system. However, relatively few papers contain detailed descriptions of the nervous system in Annelida, one of the largest taxa of Lophotrochozoa. The polychaete species Platynereis dumerilii has recently become one of the more popular model animals in evolutionary and developmental biology. The goal of the present study was to provide a detailed description of its neuronal development. The data obtained will contribute to a better understanding of the basic features of neuronal development in polychaetes. Results: We have studied the development of the nervous system in P. dumerilii utilizing histo- and immunochemical labelling of catecholamines, serotonin, FMRFamide related peptides, and acetylated tubulin. The first neuron differentiates at the posterior extremity of the protrochophore, reacts to the antibodies against both serotonin and FMRFamide. Then its fibres run forwards along the ventral side. Soon, more neurons appear at the apical extreme, and their basal neurites form the basel structure of the developing brain (cerebral neuropil and circumesophageal connectives). Initial development of the nervous system starts in two rudiments: anterior and posterior. At the nectochaete stage, segmental ganglia start to differentiate in the anterior-to-posterior direction, and the first structures of the stomatogastric and peripheral nervous systemappear. All connectives including the unpaired ventral cord develop from initially paired nerves. Conclusions: We present a detailed description of Platynereis dumerilii neuronal development based on anti-acetylated tubulin, serotonin, and FMRFamide-like immunostaining as well as catecholamine histofluorescence. The development of the nervous system starts from peripheral pioneer neurons at both the posterior and anterior poles of the larva, and their neurites form a scaffold upon which the adult central nervous systemdevelops. The anterior-to-posterior mode of the ventral ganglia development challenges the primary heteronomy concept. Comparison with the development of Mollusca reveals substantial similarities with early neuronal development in larval Solenogastres. Keywords:},

	abstract = {Regeneration, the ability to replace lost tissues and body parts following traumatic injury, occurs widely throughout the animal tree of life. Regeneration occurs either by remodeling of pre-existing tissues, through addition of new cells by cell division, or a combination of both. We describe a staging system for posterior regeneration in the annelid, Capitella teleta, and use the C. teleta Hox gene code as markers of regional identity for regenerating tissue along the anterior-posterior axis. Following amputation of different posterior regions of the animal, a blastema forms and by two days, proliferating cells are detected by EdU incorporation, demonstrating that epimorphosis occurs during posterior regeneration of C. teleta. Neurites rapidly extend into the blastema, and gradually become organized into discrete nerves before new ganglia appear approximately seven days after amputation. In situ hybridization shows that seven of the ten Hox genes examined are expressed in the blastema, suggesting roles in patterning the newly forming tissue, although neither spatial nor temporal co-linearity was detected. We hypothesized that following amputation, Hox gene expression in pre-existing segments would be re-organized to scale, and the remaining fragment would express the complete suite of Hox genes. Surprisingly, most Hox genes display stable expression patterns in the ganglia of pre-existing tissue following amputation at multiple axial positions, indicating general stability of segmental identity. However, the three Hox genes, CapI-lox4, CapI-lox2 and CapI-Post2, each shift its anterior expression boundary by one segment, and each shift includes a subset of cells in the ganglia. This expression shift depends upon the axial position of the amputation. In C. teleta, thoracic segments exhibit stable positional identity with limited morphallaxis, in contrast with the extensive body remodeling that occurs during regeneration of some other annelids, planarians and acoel flatworms.},

	abstract = {Annelids provide suitable models for studying regeneration. By now, comprehensive information is restricted to only a few taxa. For many other annelids, comparative data are scarce or even missing. Here, we describe the regeneration of a member of the Cirratulus cirratus species complex. Using phalloidin-labeling and antibody-stainings combined with subsequent confocal laser scanning microscopy, we provide data about the organization of body wall musculature and nervous system of intact specimens, as well as about anteriorly regenerating specimens. Our analyses show that C. cf. cirratus exhibits a prominent longitudinal muscle layer forming a dorsal muscle plate, two ventral muscle strands and a ventral-median muscle fiber. The circular musculature forms closed rings which are interrupted in the area of parapodia. The nervous system of C. cf. cirratus shows a typical rope-ladder like arrangement and the circumesophageal connectives exhibit two separate roots leading to the brain. During regeneration, the nervous system redevelops remarkably earlier than the musculature, first constituting a tripartite loop-like structure which later become the circumesophageal connectives. Regeneration of longitudinal musculature starts with diffuse ingrowth and subsequent structuring into the blastema. In contrast, circular musculature develops independently inside the blastema. Our findings constitute the first analysis of regeneration for a member of the Cirratuliformia on a structural level. Summarizing the regeneration process in C. cf. cirratus, five main phases can be subdivided: 1) wound closure, 2) blastema formation, 3) blastema differentiation, 4) resegmentation, and 5) growth, respectively elongation. Additionally, the described tripartite loop-like structure of the regenerating nervous system has not been reported for any other annelid taxon. In contrast, the regeneration of circular and longitudinal musculature originating from different groups of cells seems to be a general pattern in annelid regeneration. J.

	abstract = {Polychaetes are famous for their outstanding ability to regenerate lost body parts. Moreover, these worms possess a number of ancestral features in anatomy, development, and genetics, making them particularly suitable for comparative studies. Thus, fundamental as well as new undisclosed so far features of regenerative processes may be revealed, using polychaetes as a model. In the present work, we aimed to analyze the molecular basis of caudal regeneration in the nereid polychaete Alitta virens (formerly Nereis virens). We focused on homologues genes of RNA helicases Vasa and PL10 and ncRNA-binding proteins Piwi. These markers are suggested to play a significant role in maintenance of undifferentiated state of primordial germ cells and multipotent stem cells across invertebrates. In normal conditions, A. virens homologues of Vasa, PL10, and Piwi were differentially expressed in the subterminal growth zone and germline cells. Caudal amputation induced expression of studied genes de novo, which further accompanies all steps of regeneration. An early appearance of the transcripts in wound epithelium and internal blastemal cells suggests involvement of these genes in the well-known cell dedifferentiation events that assure polychaete regeneration. Provided interpretation of the gene expression dynamics implies the primary restoration of the pygidium and growth zone, which promotes following segment formation. Obtained results are valuable as a molecular fingerprint of the alterations occurring in regulatory state of locally regenerating tissues.},

	abstract = {Amphinomidae or so-called “fireworms” are known for their inflammatory substances and their regeneration ability. Recent transcriptome-based molecular analyses revealed that these remarkable annelids are a basal branching taxon outside the annelid main radiation (Pleistoannelida). Although several studies dealing with analyses of the morphology of these annelids have been published, detailed investigations of the anterior muscle regeneration and the musculature in general are largely lacking for amphinomids. Using histology, phalloidin labeling together with subsequent confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM), and further light microscopic image acquisition of different regeneration stages, we here present the first morphological study describing the myoanatomy and muscular regeneration. During anterior muscular regeneration, longitudinal muscle bundles develop prior to transverse muscle fibers and segment boundaries. Additionally, Eurythoe cf. complanata develops an independent muscular ring surrounding the mouth opening in an early stage of regeneration. Detailed investigation of adult body wall musculature and the parapodial muscle complex in amphinomids show that E. cf. complanata bears well-developed dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscle bundles as well as outer transverse muscles comparable to the pattern described for several Pleistoannelida. Furthermore, the biramous parapodia possess a complex meshwork of distinct muscle fibers allowing detailed comparisons with other annelid families. J. Morphol., 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In most bilaterians, such as mouse, human, insects, and zebrafish, their expression is mostly limited to gonadal stem cells. But there are some striking exceptions to this pattern; flatworms and acoels also express Piwi-like genes in somatic stem cells, due to their unique replacement system. Annelid species like Capitella teleta and Platynereis dumerilii express these genes in cells of the posterior growth zone as well as in gonadal stem cells. To investigate the expression pattern of Piwi-like genes in another annelid, we established in situ hybridization for adult Myzostoma cirriferum. Piwi-like gene transcripts recovered in an mRNA-seq library of pooled adult stages of M. cirriferum were expanded using RACE PCR, cloned and sequenced. ML analysis confirmed the identity of both transcripts as part of the Piwi1-like or Piwi2-like subfamily of Argonaute proteins. The results of in situ hybridization studies show that the expression of both Piwi-like genes, Mc-Piwi1 and Mc-Piwi2, is clearly located only in gonadal stem cells, and as such we did not find any evidence for the existence of a posterior growth zone nor expression in somatic stem cells.},

Cell proliferation could be demonstrated by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Antibody binding was visual-ized by fluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results show that regeneration of the nervous system occurs in two phases: (1) formation of primary neuronal structures by the " old " cord and (2) formation of new neurons in the regenerate that link up with the " old " system by their outgrowing axons. It is demonstrated that the nervous system is essential for regeneration: it induces cell proliferation in the blastema and subsequently in the regenerate. Extirpation of one ganglion retards regeneration, and extirpation of more than one ganglion prevents it completely, unless the affected segments are autotomized.},

	abstract = {Like most bilaterian animals, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii generates the majority of its body axis in an anterior to posterior temporal progression with new segments added sequentially. This process relies on a posterior subterminal proliferative body region, known as the "segment addition zone" (SAZ). We explored some of the molecular and cellular aspects of posterior elongation in Platynereis, in particular to test the hypothesis that the SAZ contains a specific set of stem cells dedicated to posterior elongation. We cloned and characterized the developmental expression patterns of orthologs of 17 genes known to be involved in the formation, behavior, or maintenance of stem cells in other metazoan models. These genes encode RNA-binding proteins (e.g., tudor, musashi, pumilio) or transcription factors (e.g., myc, id, runx) widely conserved in eumetazoans. Most of these genes are expressed both in the migrating primordial germ cells and in overlapping ring-like patterns in the SAZ, similar to some previously analyzed genes ( piwi, vasa). The SAZ patterns are coincident with the expression of proliferation markers cyclin B and PCNA. EdU pulse and chase experiments suggest that new segments are produced through many rounds of divisions from small populations of teloblast-like posterior stem cells. The shared molecular signature between primordial germ cells and posterior stem cells in Platynereis thus corresponds to an ancestral "stemness" program. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We here describe the behavior of germ-cell precursors during regeneration of the oligochaete annelid worm Enchytraeus japonensis, which has the remarkable feature of undergoing asexual (by fission) and sexual reproduction [1, 2]. We first found that the gonad can regenerate from any body fragment yielded by fission during asexual reproduction. We then examined behavior of germ-cell lineage during this regenerative process, by using a homolog of the Piwi gene (Ej-piwi) as a marker. We found that in asexually growing animals, specialized cells expressing Ej-piwi are distributed widely in the body as single cells. These cells seem to serve as a reservoir of germ-cell precursors because during asexual propagation these cells migrate into the regenerating tissue, where they ultimately settle in the prospective gonads, and give rise to germ cells upon sexualization. These cells are distinct from the neoblasts, thought to be stem cells in other animals. This is the first report to directly show that the germ and somatic lineages are segregated in asexually growing animals and behave differently during regeneration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gonads are specialized gamete-producing structures that, despite their functional importance, are generated by diverse mechanisms across groups of animals and can be among the most plastic organs of the body. Annelids, the segmented worms, are a group in which gonads have been documented to be plastic and to be able to regenerate, but little is known about what factors influence gonad development or how these structures regenerate. In this study, we aimed to identify factors that influence the presence and size of gonads and to investigate gonad regeneration in the small asexually reproducing annelid, Pristina leidyi. RESULTS: We found that gonad presence and size in asexual adult P. leidyi are highly variable across individuals and identified several factors that influence these structures. An extrinsic factor, food availability, and two intrinsic factors, individual age and parental age, strongly influence the presence and size of gonads in P. leidyi. We also found that following head amputation in this species, gonads can develop by morphallactic regeneration in previously non-gonadal segments. We also identified a sexually mature individual from our laboratory culture that demonstrates that, although our laboratory strain reproduces only asexually, it retains the potential to become fully sexual. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that gonads in P. leidyi display high phenotypic plasticity and flexibility with respect to their presence, their size, and the segments in which they can form. Considering our findings along with relevant data from other species, we find that, as a group, clitellate annelids can form gonads in at least four different contexts: post-starvation refeeding, fission, morphallactic regeneration, and epimorphic regeneration. This group is thus particularly useful for investigating the mechanisms involved in gonad formation and the evolution of post-embryonic phenotypic plasticity.},

As a polychaete annelid model for studies of the germ line, Capitella sp.

Germ line development has not been characterized in Capitella sp. I, nor is the mechanism of germ line specification generally well understood in annelids. We have cloned vasa and nanos orthologues from Capitella sp. I and found that both CapI-vasa and CapI-nanos transcripts are expressed in developing gametes of sexually mature adults. Characterization of both these genes during embryonic, larval, and juveniles stages reveals expression in multiple somatic tissues for CapI-vasa and CapI-nanos with largely overlapping but not identical expression patterns. In early cleavage stages, both transcripts are broadly expressed; following gastrulation, expression is observed in the presumptive brain, mesodermal bands, and developing foregut. Using CapI-nanos and CapI-vasa as markers, we have identified putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) in larvae, which are initially present as small bilateral clusters in segment 4 and as a single cluster at late larval stages. In adults, a single large cluster of putative PGCs is present in segments 5 and 6. In addition to highlighting differences in expression profiles for these two genes among lophotrochozoans, we present a hypothesis concerning the origin and development of PGCs in Capitella sp. I.},

Capitella teleta (formerly Capitella sp. I) is a polychaete annelid that reproduces sexually, exhibits adult growth and regeneration, and thus, is a good model to study the relationship between somatic and germline stem cells. Results: We characterize expression of the two C. teleta orthologs of piwi, genes with roles in germline development in diverse organisms. Ct-piwi1 and Ct-piwi2 are expressed throughout the life cycle in a dynamic pattern that includes both somatic and germline cells, and show nearly identical expression patterns at all stages examined. Both genes are broadly expressed during embryonic and larval development, gradually becoming restricted to putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) and the posterior growth zone. In juveniles, Ct-piwi1 is expressed in the presumptive gonads, and in reproductive adults, it is detected in gonads and the posterior growth zone. In addition, Ct-piwi1 is expressed in a population of putative PGCs that persist in sexually mature adults, likely in a stem cell niche. Ct-piwi1 is expressed in regenerating tissue, and once segments differentiate, it becomes most prominent in the posterior growth zone and immature oocytes in regenerating ovaries of regenerating segments. Conclusions: In C. teleta, piwi genes may have retained an ancestral role as genetic regulators of both somatic and germline stem cells. It is likely that piwi genes, and associated stem cell co-regulators, became restricted to the germline in some taxa during the course of evolution.},

It differs from S. ramosa in parapodial and chaetal morphology. Ramisyllis multicau-data gen. et sp. nov. has segments of several types, including specialized posterior segments on the emergent portions of the worm, and simplified elongate segments that bridge larger cavities in the sponge interior. Aside from the obvious branching form, the new annelid is similar to Parahaplosyllis, differing from it in lacking pharyngeal armature and in the details of the parapodial chaetae and dorsal cirri. Molecular evidence from 16S and 18S rDNA supports a sister-group relationship with Parahaplosyllis, with both being sister to Trypanosyllis and Eurysyllis. The phylogenetic position of R. multicaudata gen. et sp. nov. indicates that branching has evolved indepen-dently in Ramisyllis gen. nov. and Syllis. This is supported by differences in the branching process between the two taxa: in S. ramosa branching is initiated by segment addition at the parapodium, whereas in R. multicau-data gen. et sp. nov. segments are added from a region between parapodia. A model for branching in R. multi-caudata gen. et sp. nov. is proposed and possible developmental processes underlying branching in Annelida, and body symmetry comparisons with other invertebrates, are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The βcatenin-dependent Wnt pathway exerts multiple context-dependent roles in embryonic and adult tissues. In planarians, βcatenin-1 is thought to specify posterior identities through the generation of an anteroposterior gradient. However, the existence of such gradient has not been directly demonstrated. Here, we use a specific polyclonal antibody to demonstrate that nuclear βCATENIN-1 exists as an anteroposterior gradient from the pre-pharyngeal region to the tail of the planarian Schmidtea polychroa High levels in the posterior region steadily decrease towards the pre-pharyngeal region but then increase again in the head region. During regeneration, βCATENIN-1 is nuclearized in both anterior and posterior blastemas, but the canonical wnt1 ligand only influences posterior nuclearization. Additionally, βcatenin-1 is required for proper anterior morphogenesis, consistent with the high levels of nuclear βCATENIN-1 observed in this region. We further demonstrate that βCATENIN-1 is abundant in developing and differentiated organs, and is particularly required for the specification of the germ-line. Altogether, our findings provide the first direct evidence of an anteroposterior nuclear βCATENIN-1 gradient in adult planarians, and uncover novel, context-dependent roles for βcatenin-1 during anterior regeneration and organogenesis.},

	abstract = {The ability to regenerate extensive portions of the body is widespread among the phylum Annelida and this group includes some of the most highly regenerative animals known. Knowledge of the cellular and molecular basis of regeneration in this group is thus important for understanding how regenerative processes have evolved both within the group and across animal phyla. Here, the cellular basis of annelid regeneration is reviewed, with a focus on the earliest steps of regeneration, namely wound-healing and formation of the blastema. Information from a wide range of annelids is compiled in order to identify common and variable elements. There is a large body of valuable older literature on the cellular basis of regeneration in annelids and an effort is made to review this literature in addition to more recent studies. Annelids typically seal the wound through muscular contraction and undergo some autolysis of tissue at the site of the wound. Bodily injury elicits extensive cell migration toward the wound, involving several different types of cells. Some migrating cells form a tissue-clot and phagocytize damaged tissues, whereas others are inferred to contribute to regenerated tissue, specifically mesodermal tissue. In one annelid subgroup, the clitellates, a group of mesodermal cells, sometimes referred to as neoblasts, is inferred to migrate over considerable distances, with cells moving to the wound from several segments away. Epidermis and gut epithelia severed upon amputation typically heal by fusing with like tissue, although not always. After amputation, cellular contacts with the extracellular matrix are disrupted and major changes in cell morphology and adhesion occur within tissues near the wound. Interactions of tissues at the wound appear key for initiating a blastema, with a particularly important role suggested for the ventral nerve cord, although species are variable in this regard; longer-distance effects mediated by the brain are also reported. The anterior-posterior polarity of the blastema can be mis-assigned, leading most commonly to double-headed worms, and the dorsal-ventral polarity of the blastema appears to be induced by the ventral nerve cord. The blastema is thought to arise from contributions of all three tissue layers, with each layer replacing itself in a tissue-specific manner. Blastemal cells originate mostly locally, although some long-distance migration of source-cells is suggested in clitellates. A number of important questions remain about the cellular basis of regeneration in annelids and addressing many of these would be greatly aided by developing approaches to identify and isolate specific cell types and techniques to image and trace cells in vivo.},

Altogether, 228 valid species belongingto 141 genera and 44 families were recorded. This inventory adds 141 new records to previous regional reports. We founda shift in occurrence of species when comparing data from the study area with data from both southward (29–33º S) andnorthward (23–26º S) sites.

The adults of the symbiotic species Haplosyllis spongicola were the most dominant sponge endobionts. However, both juveniles and epitokes (reproductive individuals) of H. spongicola were also found, suggesting that this species completes its life cycle inside the host. Polychaete density was sig- nificantly greater in lobate sponges than in massive and encrusting forms. Conversely, the highly specific sym- biotic mode of life of H. spongicola species seems to play a major role in structuring the composition of the polychaete fauna in relation to sponge morphotypes along Rocas Atoll.},

	abstract = {Syllid annelids from the so-called ‘ribbon clade' are flattened, ribbon-shaped worms of the genera Parahaplosyllis Hartmann-Schröder, 1990, Eurysyllis Ehlers, 1864, Xenosyllis Marion \& Bobretzky, 1875, Trypanosyllis Claparède, 1864, Ramisyllis Glasby, Schroeder \& Aguado, 2012, Trypanobia Imajima \& Hartman, 1964, Plakosyllis Hartmann-Schröder, 1956, Pseudosyllis Grube, 1863 and Trypanedenta Imajima \& Hartman, 1964. Some species possess a remarkable reproductive strategy using multiple stolons that has been recently suggested to be ancestral to the group. Here, to evaluate the evolution of reproductive modes in the group, we assess, for the first time, the phylogenetic relationships within the ribbon clade and related genera. We collected new material of Trypanobia and Trypanosyllis from Japan, Spain, Philippines and Indonesia and sequenced it for the nuclear markers 18S rRNA and the mitochondrial markers 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase I for phylogenetic inference and also performed ancestral character reconstruction for the reproductive strategy in the entire group. Formal taxonomic descriptions of a new genus and six new species are provided. The new genus, Trypanospina, gen. nov., is characterised by the spines that cover its surface. Most genera within the ‘ribbon clade' are monophyletic and the relationships appeared well supported in most cases. However, our phylogenetic hypotheses are not conclusive in regard to the relationships of the genera Trypanedenta and Trypanobia, nor to the status of those to genera as distinctive, since they seem to be paraphyletic and they appear in low-supported clades. In contrast, our results shed light on the evolution of the reproductive modes within the group, showing that scissiparity (development of a single stolon each time) is the ancestral character for the entire group and gemmiparity (development of more than one stolon at the same time) then appeared twice in two independent clades.},

	doi = {10.1093/icb/icj051},
	abstract = {The annelids are an excellent group in which to investigate the evolution of regeneration abilities. They exhibit qualitative and quantitative variation in regeneration ability, including among closely related species, and their segmental body organization makes comparing results among species relatively straightforward. Here, I compile information on the presence/absence of segment regeneration ability across the annelids. The ability to regenerate posteriorly appears to be nearly universal in the annelids. It is almost certainly ancestral for the phylum and may have been lost only a few times. The ability to regenerate anteriorly is common but less widespread. It is absent in about a dozen groups, almost surely representing multiple independent losses of this ability. Several non-regenerating species are closely related to regenerating species, indicating very recent losses (or gains). Despite the fact that lack of this ability is unusual, there is a publication bias against reporting the lack of regeneration ability, and in many cases the judgment that a particular species is unable to regenerate is based on incomplete or unpublished data. Thus, in order to build rigorous frameworks for future comparative studies of annelid regeneration, there is a need for published studies clearly documenting the lack of regeneration abilities in annelid species. The review of regeneration data presented here is especially useful in highlighting annelid groups that possess both regenerating and non-regenerating representatives. Investigations of these groups may be particularly useful for elucidating the mechanisms leading to the loss (or perhaps gain) of segment regeneration ability.},

Like most Syllinae, T. pulchra reproduces by stolonization, i.e., each individual produces 3-4 posterior, detachable, gamete-bearing stolons during consecutive 30-day intervals. Although some regenerating segments are incorporated into the stolons, in this species new stolons consist primarily of stock body segments. Reproductive animals occur in the field from late January through July; maximum reproductive activity is between April and June. Long days apparently promote reproduction, but lunar synchronization of spawning could not be demonstrated. Larval development is described based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Fertilization is external; developing larvae settle within 75 hr. The development of cephalic structures (eyes and antennae) is precocious compared to other Syllinae that have been studied, and the sequence of parapodium formation is unusual.},

Essas diferenças dizem respeito à morfologia das estruturas recifais, ao tipo de sedimento do fundo, e aos seus principais organismos construtores. Os recifes distribuem-se em dois arcos ocupando uma área de aproximadamente 6.000 km2. A estrutura básica é o chapeirão, pináculo coralino com forma de cogumelo, com 5 a 25 m de altura e 5 a 50 m de diâmetro. No arco costeiro, os topos de chapeirões adjacentes coalescem lateralmente formando bancos recifais com extensão de 1 até 20 km e formas variadas. Estes bancos recifais não apresentam as zonas morfológicas descritas para os recifes do oceano Atlântico Norte. Nas suas bordas crescem crostas algais semelhantes aquelas descritas nos recifes do oceano Pacífico. O arco externo abrange recifes em franja bordejando as ilhas vulcânicas do arquipélago de Abrolhos e chapeirões isolados. Corais, mileporas e algas coralinas são os principais organismos construtores dos recifes. O número de espécies de corais é quatro vezes menor que o número de espécies descritas para os recifes do Atlântico Norte, e muitas delas são espécies endêmicas, arcaicas, isoladas de uma fauna de idade Terciária a qual tornou-se resistente ao estresse provocado pela turbidez periódica das águas brasileiras. Em contraste com a predominância de sedimentação carbonática na maioria dos recifes dos mares tropicais, os recifes costeiros de Abrolhos estão circundados por sedimentos lamosos com 40 a 70\% de areias quartzosas e minerais de argilas.},

	abstract = {St Paul's Rocks are a remote group of islets, barely 400 m across, in the equatorial mid-Atlantic (o55'N 2921'W). The results of a primarily zoological survey of the Rocks, carried out in September 1979 by the Cambridge Expedition to Saint Paul's Rocks, are reported. In addition, earlier studies of the Rocks' biology are discussed in the light of recent research. The terrestrial fauna is dominated by three species of sea-bird and a land crab. Also reported from on land are a few species of insects, ticks and spiders, an endemic pseudoscorpion, and a centipede; the majority of these species are associated with the seabirds. The islets are devoid of tracheophytes, bryophytes and lichens. The marine ecology of the Rocks is discussed with respect to habitat. Five habitats are distinguished in the supralittoral and littoral zones; the fauna and to a limited extent the flora of each is described. Sublittorally the Rocks consist almost entirely of steep escarpments extending to 60 m depth and beyond. The shallow sublittoral 60 m deep) is divided into four habitats: (1) Palythoa zone; (2) Caulerpa zone; (3) sub-Cauferpa zone, and (4) areas of unstable substrates. The Palythoa zone occupies a band extending from the base of the littoral to a depth of c. 5m and is dominated by a mat-forming hexacoral, Palythoa caribaeorum. Below this zone to a depth of c. 33 m the rock faces are thickly invested by a species of green-alga, Caulerpa racemosa. At depth this Caulerpa dominated zone is succeeded by an invertebrate dominated community. Unstable substrates are represented by a few pockets of coarse sand and some patches of rubble. The communities in each of these habitats are described. A primarily taxonomic review of the deep-water fauna is also included. Finally, the influence of ocean currents on the zoogeographical relationships of the Rocks' fauna is briefly examined.},

It is 90 km long, 25 km wide, and 3,800 m high, and is called the Saint Peter Saint Paul Peridotite Ridge. The submarine morphology is highly rugged with hundreds-of- meters-high scarps, suggesting the occurrence of probably recent active tectonism. The summit level map shows two surfaces of wave-cut benches with respective altitudes of 4∼5 m and 7∼9 m. The wave-cut benches are observed on three major islets in the same altitude ranges, indicating that no tilting or differential uplifting between the islets has occurred. Considering the upper platform to be formed during the Flandrian Transgression and the lower one developed by a recent erosive process, the mean uplift rate in the last 6.000 years is calculated to be 1.2∼1.5 mm/year. The 14 C datings for the coral fossils collected from the Belmont Island indicate the uplift rate in the last 6600 years to be 1.5∼1.8 mm/year. Therefore, a rate of 1.5 mm/year should be reasonable for the present-day uplifting. Interpreting the peridotite ridge as a tectonically deformed megamullion, the total uplift would be 1500∼3000 m and the tectonism should have started at 1∼2 Ma. If the Peridotite Ridge is originated from the subcrustal oceanic mantle, the total uplift would be approximately 9000 m and the tectonism would have started close to 6 Ma.},

	abstract = {Background: The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. Results: There are ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms, that 58,000-72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000-741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7-1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37\% (median 31\%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science. Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Ramisyllis multicaudata is a member of Syllidae (Annelida, Errantia, Phyllodocida) with a remarkable branching body plan. Using a next-generation sequencing approach, the complete mitochondrial genomes of R. multicaudata and Trypanobia sp. are sequenced and analysed, representing the first ones from Syllidae. The gene order in these two syllids does not follow the order proposed as the putative ground pattern in Errantia. The phylogenetic relationships of R. multicaudata are discerned using a phylogenetic approach with the nuclear 18S and the mitochondrial 16S and cox1 genes. Ramisyllis multicaudata is the sister group of a clade containing Trypanobia species. Both genera, Ramisyllis and Trypanobia, together with Parahaplosyllis, Trypanosyllis, Eurysyllis, and Xenosyllis are located in a long branched clade. The long branches are explained by an accelerated mutational rate in the 18S rRNA gene. Using a phylogenetic backbone, we propose a scenario in which the postembryonic addition of segments that occurs in most syllids, their huge diversity of reproductive modes, and their ability to regenerate lost parts, in combination, have provided an evolutionary basis to develop a new branching body pattern as realised in Ramisyllis.},

The first analysis included one species of each of the 71 genera of the Syllidae, as well as members of other close families. In the second analysis, 23 poorly known genera were excluded. Character information is based on the examination of available types, additional non-types and newly collected material. Syllidae, except Bollandia Glasby, 1994 is mono- phyletic. Both analyses supported three of the four traditional subfamilies (Exogoninae, Syllinae and Autolytinae) as monophyletic, whereas Eusyllinae was clearly a polyphyletic group. The genera Anoplosyllis Claparède, 1868, Astreptosyllis Kudenov \& Dorsey, 1982, Streptosyllis Webster \& Benedict, 1884, Streptospinigera Kudenov, 1983 and Syllides Örsted, 1845 comprise a well-supported monophyletic group, which we classified as a new subfamily: Anoplosyllinae n. subfam. Our results indicated high levels of homoplasy in the morphological characteristics that traditionally used to differentiate groups, such as the fusion of palps and the presence of nuchal epaulettes. Considering the reproductive modes, schizogamy has appeared twice in the family as the derived condition evolving from epigamy, and Exogoninae may be divided into two monophyletic groups based on the brood system.},

We have recently described the expression of 10 out of 11 Hox genes during postlarval growth of Alitta (Nereis) virens. Hox genes form gradient overlapping expression patterns, which probably do not contribute to the morphological diversity of segments along the anterior-posterior axis of the homonomously segmented worm.

	abstract = {The genus Haplosyllides was considered as monotypic, with H. floridana as the only valid species. The present revision Includes two more species in this genus: H. aberrans comb. nov. and H. ophiocomae sp. nov. Syllis (Haplosyllis) aberrans (from Vietnam) was considered a Junior synonym of H. floridana (from the Caribbean). The finding of additional specimens from Vietnam and Indonesia, and the study of the type series, allowed us to redescribe H. aberrans comb. nov. on the basis of morphological, ecological and biogeographical characteristics. Haplosyllides aberrans comb. nov. differs from H. floridana in having posterior simple chaetae with tips twice as long, a pharyngeal tooth in all non-reproductive Individuals, and the granules Inside the dorsal cirri oval, elongated, and roughly distributed in longitudinal parallel rows. Haplosyllides ophiocomae sp. nov. was previously reported (as H. aberrans) from Puerto Rico. Although geographically close, It differs from H. floridana in having serration on the upper edge of the major teeth of simple chaetae, relatively shorter dorsal cirri, and a distinct mode of life. Haplosyllides floridana lives as an endosimbiont of Xetospongia muta, H. aberrans comb. nov. as a facultative parasite of Platycaris latirostris, and H. ophiocomae sp. nov. as a commensal of Ophiocoma pumila and other brittle stars. The meaning of these associations is discussed in light of the available Information. The remaining records of "Haplosyllides aberrans" from the Marshall Islands (associated with corals of the genus Heliopora) and from Brazil (among corals and calcareous algae) are considered as doubtful.},

	abstract = {Complete mitochondrial genomes of five syllids (Streptosyllis sp., Eusyllis blomstrandi, Myrianida brachycephala, Typosyllis antoni and Typosyllis sp.) have been obtained using Illumina sequencing. Together with two previous studied taxa (Ramisyllis multicaudata and Trypanobia cryptica), the analysed sequences represent most of the main lineages within the family Syllidae (Anoplosyllinae, Eusyllinae, Autolytinae and Syllinae). The genomic features, gene order and phylogenetic relationships are examined. Unusual for annelids, syllid mitochondrial genomes are highly variable in their gene order. Considering genomic features, such as length, skewness, gene content, and codon bias, most similar to the rest of annelids are the genomes of E. blomstrandi and M. brachycephala, while Streptosyllis sp. and the analysed sylline taxa (R. multicaudata, T. cryptica, T. antoni and Typosyllis sp.) are the most dissimilar. Two methionine tRNA's (trnM) have been found in T. antoni and Typosyllis sp. The mt genomes of these latter taxa are the longest with numerous non-coding regions. The 13 protein coding genes, as well as the rRNA's are used to perform phylogenetic analyses that recovered the relationships within the family explored before by previous authors. The gene order in Syllidae shows very different patterns. E. blomstrandi and M. prolifera show a similar pattern to the one found in Pleistoannelida; however this might have changed at least twice within Syllidae: in Streptosyllis sp. and within Syllinae. All analysed Syllinae show different gene orders, thereby illustrating more variability as all other pleistoannelids analysed so far. The information provided herein allows a more accurate reconstruction of the possible evolutionary scenarios in Syllidae.},

Maximum parsimony analysis of the combined data set indicates that Syllidae, as currently delineated, is monophyletic, though not with very high support values. Astreptosyllis Kudenov \& Dorsey, 1982, Streptosyllis Webster \& Benedict, 1884 and Syllides rsted, 1845 comprise a monophyletic group well differentiated from the rest of the Syllidae. The subfamilies Autolytinae and Syllinae are monophyletic. Exogoninae is monophyletic, although not well supported, and Eusyllinae is clearly paraphyletic. Results corroborate previous studies about the evolution of reproductive modes in that epigamy is the plesiomorphic condition and schizogamy appeared independently in Autolytinae and Syllinae.},

	abstract = {Many marine invertebrates are able to regenerate lost tissue following injury, but regeneration can come at a cost to individuals in terms of reproduction, behavior and physiological condition, and can have effects that reach beyond the individual to impact populations, communities, and ecosystems. For example, removal and subsequent regeneration of clams' siphons, polychaetes' segments, and brittlestars' arms can represent significant energetic input to higher trophic levels. In marine soft-sediment habitats, injury changes infaunal bioturbation rates and thus secondarily influences sediment-mediated competition, adult-larval interactions, and recruitment success. The importance of injury and regeneration as factors affecting the ecology of marine invertebrate communities depends on the frequency of injury, as well as on individual capacity for, and speed of, regeneration. A key question to answer is: "How frequently are marine benthic invertebrates injured?" Here, I review the sources and the frequencies of injury in a variety of marine invertebrates from different benthic habitats, discuss challenges, and approaches for accurately determining injury rates in the field, consider evidence for species-specific, temporal and geographic variation in injury rates, and present examples of indirect effects of injury on marine invertebrates to illustrate how injury and regeneration can modify larger-scale ecological patterns and processes.},

	abstract = {Networks can greatly advance data sharing attitudes by providing organized and useful data sets on marine biodiversity in a friendly and shared scientific environment. NONATObase, the interactive database on polychaetes presented herein, will provide new macroecological and taxonomic insights of the Southwestern Atlantic region. The database was developed by the NONATO network, a team of South American researchers, who integrated available information on polychaetes from between 5°N and 80°S in the Atlantic Ocean and near the Antarctic. The guiding principle of the database is to keep free and open access to data based on partnerships. Its architecture consists of a relational database integrated in the MySQL and PHP framework. Its web application allows access to the data from three different directions: species (qualitative data), abundance (quantitative data) and data set (reference data). The database has built-in functionality, such as the filter of data on user-defined taxonomic levels, characteristics of site, sample, sampler, and mesh size used. Considering that there are still many taxonomic issues related to poorly known regional fauna, a scientific committee was created to work out consistent solutions to current misidentifications and equivocal taxonomy status of some species. Expertise from this committee will be incorporated by NONATObase continually. The use of quantitative data was possible by standardization of a sample unit. All data, maps of distribution and references from a data set or a specified query can be visualized and exported to a commonly used data format in statistical analysis or reference manager software. The NONATO network has initialized with NONATObase, a valuable resource for marine ecologists and taxonomists. The database is expected to grow in functionality as it comes in useful, particularly regarding the challenges of dealing with molecular genetic data and tools to assess the effects of global environment change.

Patterns in the community structure of meiofauna and macrofauna, particularly nematodes and polychaetes, at Rocas Atoll, north-east Brazil, are determined and compared for different habitats: sublittoral, tidal flat, reef pools and lagoon. Nematodes and copepods were the most abundant meiofaunal taxa. In all studied habitats at Rocas Atoll, oligochaetes, nematodes and polychaetes numerically dominate the macrofauna. Univariate and multivariate analyses reveal clear differences in community structure between the habitats of the atoll, especially between the sublittoral and the inner habitats. The number of species, total density, diversity (H) and trophic structure vary significantly between the habitats, but the differences are dependent on which faunistic category (meiobenthic or macrobenthic) is analysed. Nematodes belonging to the Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae, together with a diverse community of meiobenthic polychaetes, characterize the sublittoral habitat of Rocas Atoll. Both meiofauna and macrofauna are depressed in the tidal flat, and the local sediment instability particularly affects the polychaete abundance. Reef pools and lagoons support a very dense aggregation of invertebrates, particularly the macrofauna, when compared with other carbonate reef sediments. However, differences in the structure of meiofauna and macrofauna communities between reef pools and lagoons are not significant. Changes in meiobenthic and macrobenthic community structure are related to the gradation in the physical environment of the atoll. 0},

	abstract = {Echiura is traditionally regarded as a small phylum of unsegmented spiralian worms. Molec- ular analyses, however, provide unquestionable evidence that Echiura are derived annelids that lost segmentation. Like annelids, echiurans possess chaetae, a single ventral pair in all species and one or two additional caudal hemi-circles of chaetae in two subgroups, but their evolutionary origin and affiliation to annelid chaetae are unresolved. Since annelids pos- sess segmental pairs of dorsal (notopodial) and ventral (neuropodial) chaetae that are ar- ranged in a row, the ventral chaetae in Echiura either represent a single or a paired neuropodial group of chaetae, while the caudal circle may represent fused rows of chaetae. In annelids, chaetogenesis is generally restricted to the ventral part of the notopodial chae- tal sac and to the dorsal part of the neuropodial chaetal sac.We used the exact position of the chaetal formation site in the echiuran species, Thalassema thalassemum (Pallas, 1766) and Echiurus echiurus (Pallas, 1767), to test different hypotheses of the evolution of echiurid chaetae. As in annelids, a single chaetoblast is responsible for chaetogenesis in both spe- cies. Each chaeta of the ventral pair arises from its own chaetal sac and possesses a lateral formation site, evidencing that the pair of ventral chaetae in Echiura is homologous to a pair of neuropodia that fused on the ventral side, while the notopodia were reduced. Both caudal hemi-circles of chaetae in Echiurus echiurus are composed of several individual chaetal sacs, each with its own formative site. This finding argues against a homology of these hemi-circles of chaetae and annelids' rows of chaetae and leads to the hypothesis that the caudal chaetal rings evolved once within the Echiura bymultiplication of ventral chaetae.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Annelids exhibit great regenerative abilities, which are mainly used after injury or during reproduction. These lophotrochozoans thus represent excellent models for regeneration research. However, detailed morphological studies concerning annelid musculature and nervous system redevelopment are limited to few taxa, and do not allow for broader comparisons and general conclusions regarding common patterns amongst annelids. RESULTS: Using immunohistochemical staining combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM), we investigated the redevelopment of body wall musculature and nervous system during anterior and posterior posttraumatic regeneration in Timarete cf. punctata. Both regeneration processes start with wound healing, blastema formation, and blastema patterning. In posterior regeneration, this leads to the development of a new pygidium and a segment addition zone (SAZ) anterior to this structure. New segments are subsequently added in a sequential fashion. Anterior regeneration in contrast shows the formation of a new prostomium and peristomium first, followed by the simultaneous redevelopment of three segments, and an additional three segments in sequential order. Anterior muscular regeneration shows an outgrowth of longitudinal musculature from the residual body wall musculature, while circular musculature develops independently within the blastema. During posterior regeneration, new musculature becomes visible when the new segments reached a certain age. Neuronal regeneration begins with neurite outgrowth from the old ventral nerve cord in both cases, which are later forming loop structures. In anterior regeneration, the brain redevelops at the anteriormost position of the loops. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior regeneration recapitulates normal growth from a certain timepoint with serial segment development by a posterior segment addition zone. Anterior regeneration is more complex, showing similarities to larval development in matters of the order, in which prostomium, peristomium, and segments are generated. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of regeneration studies to investigate morphological structures and evolutionary processes.},

The posterior part of the abdomen undergoes spontaneous fission into from 2 to 4 fragments and depending on their position, the frag-ments regenerate their anterior ends or both anterior and posterior ends. Regeneration in P. reniformis takes place via a combination of epimorphosis (replacement of missing parts by cell proliferation and the growth of new tissue) and mor-phallaxis (the remodelling of pre-existing structures without cell proliferation). The morphogenetic events during regener-ative restoration include de novo formation of branchial crown, formation of thoracic segments and restoration of the posterior end.

	abstract = {The debate on the origin of segmentation is a central question in the study of body plan evolution in metazoans. Annelids are the most conspicuously metameric animals as most of the trunk is formed of identical anatomical units. In this paper, I summarize the various patterns of evolution of the metameric body plan in annelids, showing the remarkable evolvability of this trait, similar to what is also found in arthropods. I then review the different modes of segment formation in the annelid tree, taking into account the various processes taking place in the life histories of these animals, including embryogenesis, post-embryonic development, regeneration and asexual reproduction. As an example of the variations that occur at the cellular and genetic level in annelid segment formation, I discuss the processes of teloblastic growth or posterior addition in key groups in the annelid tree. I propose a comprehensive definition for the teloblasts, stem cells that are responsible for sequential segment addition. There are a diversity of different mechanisms used in annelids to produce segments depending on the species, the developmental time and also the life history processes of the worm. A major goal for the future will be to reconstitute an ancestral process (or several ancestral processes) in the ancestor of the whole clade. This in turn will provide key insights in the current debate on ancestral bilaterian segmentation.},

	abstract = {The capability of regenerating posterior segments and pygidial structures is ancestral for annelids and has been lost only a few times within this phylum. As one of the three major segmented taxa, annelids enable us to monitor reconstruction of lost tissues and organs. During regeneration, regional identities have to be imprinted onto the newly formed segments. In this study, we show spatial and temporal localization of expression of nine Hox genes during caudal regeneration of the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii. Hox genes are homeodomain genes encoding transcriptional regulators of axial patterning in bilaterian animals during development. We demonstrate that five Platynereis Hox genes belonging to paralog groups (PG) 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9-14 are expressed in domains of the regenerating nervous system consistent with providing positional information along the anteroposterior axis of the regenerate. We report that expression in regenerating neuromeres is limited to varying subsets of perikarya, called gangliosomes. Four of nine genes analyzed do not appear to be involved in axial patterning. Two genes, Pdu-Hox2 and Pdu-Hox3, are predominantly expressed in the growth zone region. For some Hox genes expression in newly formed coelomic epithelia can be observed. Platynereis Hox genes do not exhibit temporal or spatial colinearity. Although there are some similarities to previously reported expression patterns during larval and postlarval development in Nereididae (Kulakova et al. 2007), expression patterns observed during caudal regeneration also show unique patterns.},

	abstract = {Whole-body regeneration is widespread in the Metazoa, yet little is known about how underlying molecular mechanisms compare across phyla. Acoels are an enigmatic phylum of invertebrate worms that can be highly informative about many questions in bilaterian evolution, including regeneration. We developed the three-banded panther worm, Hofstenia miamia, as a new acoelomorph model system for molecular studies of regeneration. Hofstenia were readily cultured, with accessible embryos, juveniles, and adults for experimentation. We developed molecular resources and tools for Hofstenia, including a transcriptome and robust systemic RNAi. We report the identification of molecular mechanisms that promote whole-body regeneration in Hofstenia. Wnt signaling controls regeneration of the anterior-posterior axis, and Bmp-Admp signaling controls regeneration of the dorsal-ventral axis. Perturbation of these pathways resulted in regeneration-abnormal phenotypes involving axial feature duplication, such as the regeneration of two heads following Wnt perturbation or the regeneration of ventral cells in place of dorsal ones following bmp or admp RNAi. Hofstenia regenerative mechanisms are strikingly similar to those guiding regeneration in planarians. However, phylogenetic analyses using the Hofstenia transcriptome support an early branching position for acoels among bilaterians, with the last common ancestor of acoels and planarians being the ancestor of the Bilateria. Therefore, these findings identify similar whole-body regeneration mechanisms in animals separated by more than 550 million years of evolution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Competing hypotheses explaining the presence of distinct segmented taxa range from the suggestion that all segmentation in the metazoa is homologous to the proposal that segmentation arose independently many times, even within an individual clade or species. A major new source of information regarding the extent of homology vs. homoplasy of segmentation in recent years has been an examination of the extent to which molecular mechanisms underlying the segmentation process are conserved, the rationale being that a shared history will be apparent by the presence of common molecular components of a developmental program that give rise to a segmented body plan. There has been substantial progress recently in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the segmentation process in many groups, specifically within the three overtly segmented phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda and Chordata. This review will discuss what we currently know about the segmentation process in each group and how our understanding of the development of segmented structures in distinct taxa have influenced the hypotheses explaining the presence of a segmented body plan in the metazoa.},

These include results related to the role of both cell contact and local soluble factors in regeneration of the legs of insects and newts and of the parapodia and segments of nereis. The pattern of these structures is considered to be defined by positional information distributed as longitudinal and transverse positional value sequences carried by epidermal (insect) or mesenchymal (newt) cells. By associating tissues to create transverse and longitudinal discontinuities in these sequences, single or multiple regenerating structures were obtained. These structures are formed by the intercalation of cells characterized by intermediate positional values which fill the gap between the tissues in contact. Positional information may also be changed during regeneration by the nerve cord in nereis and retinoids in the newts. We describe additional cases where morphogenesis occurs without any overt discontinuity in positional information, such as from a locally injured or non-injured insect trochanter, or after deflection of nerves in nereis and newt. Regeneration following an amputation may be considered as a special case of intercalary regeneration, the first stage being the juxtaposition of normally non-contiguous cells resulting in a longitudinal or/and a transverse gap. We also report studies on local factors produced by nerves and the blastema during newt limb regeneration. The nerve factor is necessary for the division of blastemal cells. After denervation, mesenchyme differentiates in an abnormal way. The mitogenic signal from the nerves is mediated by the PKC pathway. Its production is enhanced by regeneration of cut nerve fibers. The blastema also produces growth factors. We show that the epidermal cap and mesenchyme contain acidic FGF-like factor, and that the proliferating mesenchyme stimulates nerve fibers to regrow into the blastema.},

	abstract = {Syllids are one of the most speciose annelid taxa and characterized by their variety of reproductive modes. We provide the description of a new species of Syllidae (Annelida, Phyllodocida), Typosyllis antoni n. sp., which is characterized by its distinct color pattern consisting of transversal red lines on the dorsum of anterior segments; long antennae and dorsal cirri with strong alternation in length; bidentate chaetae falciger like with long spinulation on edge, one tiny and thin acicula appearing in posterior segments in addition to thicker and pointed one, and a long proventricle. A phylogenetic analysis of Syllinae based on three genes supports that T. antoni n. sp. is sister species to Typosyllis heronislandensis. This sister group relationship may indicate a common ancestor from the Pacific. Moreover, we recommend several steps to unify the taxonomy with phylogenetic knowledge of this group. Using immunocytochemistry coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM), we describe the internal morphology of this species. The body wall is composed of two dorsal and two ventral longitudinal muscle bundles that form a distinct inner layer. The outer or “circular layer” of body wall musculature is represented by prominent transverse muscle fibers that exhibit a semicircular arrangement. The musculature of the uniramous parapodia is characterized by distinct parapodial retractor muscles, acicular protractor muscles, as well as prominent acicular and chaetal flexor muscle bundles. T. antoni n. sp. reproduces by schizogamic scissiparity producing dicerous stolons. This species is able to regenerate the anterior end, including the prostomium, the first chaetae-less segment with all appendages, and some additional chaetigers, depending on the dissection side. Regeneration of the proventricle, ventricle, caeca, or pharyngeal tooth is not detectable. In contrast, regeneration of the posterior end appears to be complete. The available data makes T. antoni n. sp. to be one of the best investigated syllids, emphasizing its potential as model for the whole group. Our analysis establishes a framework for future studies on the evolution of reproductive modes in Syllidae, and we outline research questions how they are related to regeneration and development.},

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ∼8.7 million (± 1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (± 0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86\% of existing species on Earth and 91\% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

O número de espécies registradas é muito inferior ao conhecido para o mundo, o que reflete a falta de estudos dessa fauna. O número de espécies endêmicas é relativamente alto e a região mais estudada está limitada à zona entremarés até aproxima- damente 20m de profundidade. A biodiversidade de peixes demersais e pelágicos é uniforme entre as grandes regiões e o endemismo é relativamente baixo ({\textbackslash}textless5\%), estando restrito às espécies recifais. Em estudos recentes realizados no Sudeste do Brasil (profundidade até 2000m), foram registradas mais de 1.300 espécies de animais bentônicos, dos quais Porifera, Cnidaria, Sipuncula, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Scaphopoda, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Ophiuroidea, Bryozoa e Brachiopoda foram os mais abundantes ou freqüentes. Excetuando-se os moluscos, decápodes (braquiúros), cirripédios e equinodermos, a fauna de marismas, recifes de corais e ilhas per- manece pouco conhecida. Os teleósteos demersais marinhos e estuarinos incluem 617 espé- cies distribuídos em 26 ordens e 118 famílias. Pouco mais da metade das espécies (337) são Perciformes. A sobreexplotação para consumo e/ou comércio de peixes ornamentais, a degra- dação e/ou descaracterização de habitats, a introdução de espécies exóticas, o turismo desordenado e a poluição, constituem fatores de ameaça às espécies marinhas. O Ministério do Meio Ambiente incluiu, em Instrução Normativa, 34 espécies do bentos marinho como ameaçadas e dez como sobreexplotadas ou em risco de sobreexplotação. Em relação aos peixes, quinze espécies de tubarões e raias e sete de teleósteos estão ameaçadas de extinção, enquanto seis espécies de elasmobrânquios e 27 de teleósteos estão sobreexplotadas ou ameaçadas de sobreexplotação. A conservação da biodiversidade marinha no Brasil ainda é consideravelmente inadequada a despeito da legislação existente e das áreas protegidas ma- rinhas implantadas. As unidades de conservação são insuficientes em número e extensão e, em alguns casos, não tiveram seus planos de manejo elaborados ou implementados ou care- cem de infra-estrutura para efetivá-las. A gestão da atividade pesqueira ainda é precária, com baixa participação das comunidades envolvidas. As principais iniciativas de conservação in- cluem a identificação de áreas-chave para a conservação da biodiversidade, inventários, moni- toramento intensivo da atividade pesqueira, educação ambiental e a criação de áreas protegi- das e melhoria da gestão daquelas já existentes.

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, advances in molecular techniques have led to the detection of strong geographic population structure and cryptic speciation in many benthic marine taxa, even those with long-lived pelagic larval stages. Polychaete annelids, in particular, generally show a high degree of population divergence, especially in mitochondrial genes. Rarely have molecular studies confirmed the presence of 'cosmopolitan' species. The amphinomid polychaete Hermodice carunculata was long considered the sole species within its genus, with a reported distribution throughout the Atlantic and adjacent basins. However, recent studies have indicated morphological differences, primarily in the number of branchial filaments, between the East and West Atlantic populations; these differences were invoked to re-instate Hermodice nigrolineata, formerly considered a junior synonym of H. carunculata. We utilized sequence data from two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) markers and one nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) marker to examine the genetic diversity of Hermodice throughout its distribution range in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Guinea. Our analyses revealed generally low genetic divergences among collecting localities and between the East and West Atlantic, although phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial data indicate the presence of a private lineage in the Mediterranean Sea. A re-evaluation of the number of branchial filaments confirmed differences between East and West Atlantic populations; however, the differences were not diagnostic and did not reflect the observed genetic population structure. Rather, we suspect that the number of branchial filaments is a function of oxygen saturation in the environment. Our results do not support the distinction between H. carunculata in the West Atlantic and H. nigrolineata in the East Atlantic. Instead, they re-affirm the older notion that H. carunculata is a cohesive species with a broad distribution across the Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Islands are particular environments, because their geographical isolation often leads to a unique biota, with many endemic species. Invasive exotic species are currently regarded as the second leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, and island biodiversity is potentially more vulnerable due to the large number of endemic species and small habitat area. The Brazilian oceanic islands – the islands of Fernando de Noronha, São Pedro and São Paulo, Martin Vaz, Ilha da Trindade and Atol das Rocas – vary in size and distance from the mainland and carry a particular biodiversity. In this work, from a survey of the literature, we discuss the known biodiversity and its relationship to the history of use and occupation of the islands. Among the taxa already studied, reef fish and sponges stand out as groups with high endemism in the marine environment. In the terrestrial environment, vascular plants are to be highlighted, despite the huge knowledge gap in relation to other groups, for example, terrestrial invertebrates. Fernando de Noronha has the largest known number of species, both marine and terrestrial, due mainly to its size and variety of habitats, but also because it is the most studied of the islands. At the same time, it is the island that suffered the largest interference in the structure of its biodiversity, especially the terrestrial one, and today most of the vertebrate species are exotic. This is a result of a long history of use and occupation - not only in Fernando de Noronha, but also in other islands - from its discovery in the sixteenth century until today. Current known biodiversity, especially that of the terrestrial environment, does not reflect the diversity existing when the islands where discovered by man and their occupation started. Fernando de Noronha and Trindade suffered massive deforestation. In Trindade, the original vegetation – dominated by a single native tree species – occupying 85\% of the island, was almost extinct due to the action of goats and direct exploitation by humans. Currently, all Brazilian oceanic islands have some form of resources use control, aiming directly or indirectly to biodiversity conservation, which is still very rich, especially with regard to the marine environment. There remain obvious challenges to manage these environments in order to balance use and occupation and the conservation of biodiversity.},

Outgroups included 12 non-autolytine syllids and four other annelids from related groups. The phylogeny was used to trace the evolution of the various reproductive strategies (i.e., epigamy, anterior and posterior scissiparity, and gemmiparity) within the group, and it will also serve as a basis for a forthcoming revision of autolytine taxonomy. The two genes were analysed both separately and in combination using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Regardless of method used the combined analysis supported a division of Autolytinae into three major clades: one with epigamous Autolytus; a second comprising Autolytus and Myrianida with posterior scissiparity and gemmiparity; and a third containing Proceraea, Procerastea, and Virchowia with anterior scissiparity. The relationship between these three groups is uncertain. Ancestral reproductive states were reconstructed with parsimony and maximum likelihood, and the results unequivocally support epigamy as the plesiomorphic reproductive mode in Syllidae, and that schizogamy in Syllinae and Autolytinae are separate events. The evolution of reproductive traits is ambiguous within Autolytinae, and either of the different reproductive modes could represent the ancestral state. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	abstract = {Background: In the polychaete Platynereis, the primordial germ cells (PGCs) emerge from the vasa, piwi, and PL10 expressing mesodermal posterior growth zone (MPGZ) at the end of larval development, suggesting a post- embryonic formation from stem cells. Methods: In order to verify this hypothesis, embryos and larvae were pulse labeled with the proliferation marker 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) at different stages of development. Subsequently, the PGCs were visualized in 7- day-old young worms using antibodies against the Vasa protein. Results: Surprisingly, the primordial germ cells of Platynereis incorporate EdU only shortly before gastrulation (6-8 hours post fertilization (hpf)), which coincides with the emergence of four small blastomeres from the mesoblast lineage. We conclude that these so-called ‘secondary mesoblast cells' constitute the definitive PGCs in Platynereis.In contrast, the cells of the MPGZ incorporate EdU only from the pre-trochophore stage onward (14 hpf). Conclusion: While PGCs and the cells of the MPGZ in Platynereis are indistinguishable in morphology and both express the germline markers vasa, nanos, and piwi, a distinct cluster of PGCs is detectable anterior of the MPGZ following EdU pulse-labeling. Indeed the PGCs form independently from the stem cells of the MPGZ prior to gastrulation. Our data suggest an early PGC formation in the polychaete by preformation rather than by epigenesis.},

	abstract = {Research on the regeneration potential of flatworms (Platyhelminthes) has been mainly undertaken with planarians (Tricladida), where most species can regenerate a head and no proliferation takes place in the blastema, i.e. the early undifferentiated regenerative tissue. Only few studies are available for an early-branching group within the Platyhelminthes, the Polycladida. Head regeneration in polyclads is not possible, with a single exception from a study performed more than 100 years ago: Cestoplana was reported to be able to regenerate a head if cut a short distance behind the brain. Here, we show that ‘Cestoplana’ was misdetermined and most likely was the small interstitial polyclad Theama mediterranea. We revisited regeneration capacity and dynamics of T. mediterranea with live observations and stainings of musculature, nervous system, and proliferating and differentiating stem cells. In our experiments, after transversal amputation, only animals retaining more than half of the brain could fully restore the head including the brain. If completely removed, the brain was never found to regenerate to any extent. Different from planarians, but comparable to other free-living flatworms we detected cell proliferation within the posterior regeneration blastema in T. mediterranea. Similar to other free-living flatworms, proliferation did not occur within, but only outside, the differentiating organ primordia. Our results strongly imply that brain regeneration in the absence of the latter is not possible in any polyclad studied so far. Also, it appears that proliferation of stem cells within the regeneration blastema is a plesiomorphy in flatworms and that planarians are derived in this character.},

We traced lineages at single-cell resolution within 4d and demonstrate that embryonic segmental mesoderm forms via teloblastic divisions, as in clitellate annelids. We also identified the precise cellular origins of the larval mesodermal posterior growth zone. We found that differentially-fated progeny of 4d (germline, segmental mesoderm, growth zone) display significantly different cell cycling.

Here, we have used this technique to express proteins that can serve as lineage tracers or reporters of cellular events in embryos of the glossiphoniid leech Helobdella robusta (phylum Annelida). As representatives of the proposed super-phylum Lophotrochozoa, glossiphoniid leeches are of interest for developmental and evolutionary comparisons. Their embryos are suitable for microinjection, but no genetic approaches are currently available. We have injected segmentation stem cells (teloblasts) with mRNAs encoding nuclear localized green fluorescent protein (nGFP) and its spectral variants, and have used tandem injections of nGFP mRNA followed by antisense morpholino oligomer (AS MO), to label single blast cell clones. These techniques permit high resolution cell lineage tracing in living embryos. We have applied them to the primary neurogenic (N) lineage, in which alternate segmental founder cells (nf and ns blast cells) contribute distinct sets of progeny to the segmental ganglia. The nf and ns blast cell clones exhibit strikingly different cell division patterns: the increase in cell number within the nf clone is roughly linear, while that in the ns clone is almost exponential. To analyze spindle dynamics in the asymmetric divisions of individual blast cells, we have injected teloblasts with mRNA encoding a tau::GFP fusion protein. Our results show that the asymmetric divisions of n blast cells result from a posterior shift of both the spindle within the cell and the midbody within the mitotic spindle, with differential regulation of these processes between nf and ns.},

	abstract = {The origin of evolutionary novelties is a central topic in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) studies. In any new feature, there is a conserved component that is either structural or related to the underlying genetic control, but it is not always obvious what is really new and what is conserved. Nevertheless, disentangling this blending of old and new features is basic to understanding mechanisms of evolutionary change. The origin of arthropod appendages illustrates the complexity in tracing the origin of evolutionary novelties. At the base of the lineage, the main body axis was already segmented and antero-posteriorly patterned, and the genetic tool kit required to form lateral outgrowths was already available. The novelty was possibly the developmental decision to "read" the available axial information and to exploit it for differentiating segmentally patterned and axially segmented appendages. Some important novelties bridge the gap between what have been traditionally distinguished as systemic and local changes. For example, the origin of the body cavities evolved by several animal groups may have been initiated by simple changes in cell-to-cell adhesive properties. Any possible change in an existing ontogenetic pathway has the potential to generate novelties. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

They have been used mostly by the paleontological community in an effort to get the most out of one of the only pieces of evidence that fossil material usually provide: the morphology of hard parts. The expectation with the establishment of theoretical morphospaces is that, by abstracting and modeling the fundamental parts of form, the multiple processes that generate the phenotypes of embryonic and adult structures will be better understood. In this essay, we suggest that ontogenetic trajectories can be used as the generative functions that build morphospaces, and propose approaches to build theoretical models for the establishment of left-right asymmetries during vertebrate heart embryogenesis. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Morphological modularity arises in complex living beings due to a semi-independent inheritance, development, and function of body parts. Modularity helps us to understand the evolvability and plasticity of organismal form, and how morphological variation is structured during evolution and development. For this reason, delimiting morphological modules and establishing the factors involved in their origins is a lively field of inquiry in biology today. Although it is thought that modularity is pervasive in all living beings, actually we do not know how often modularity is present in different morphological systems. We also do not know whether some methodological approaches tend to reveal modular patterns more easily than others, or whether some factors are more related to the formation of modules or the integration of the whole phenotype. This systematic review seeks to answer these type of questions through an examination of research investigating morphological modularity from 1958 to present. More than 200 original research articles were gathered in order to reach a quantitative appraisal on what is studied, how it is studied, and how the results are explained. The results reveal an heterogeneous picture, where some taxa, systems, and approaches are over-studied, while others receive minor attention. Thus, this review points out various trends and gaps in the study of morphological modularity, offering a broad picture of current knowledge and where we can direct future research efforts.},

The foregut gives rise to the buccal cavity, pharnyx and oesophagus, the midgut may be divided into a stomach and the intestine proper. Since polychaetes use a wide spectrum of food sources, structures involved in feeding vary as well and show numerous specializations. In the foregut these specializations may be classified as one of the following types: dorsolateral folds, ventral pharynx, axial muscular pharynx, axial non-muscular proboscis and dorsal pharynx. The latter, typical of oligochaetous Clitellata, occurs rarely in polychaetes. The structure, evolution and phylogenetic importance of these different types are described and discussed. Axial muscular and ventral pharynges may be armed with jaws, sclerotized parts of the pharyngeal cuticle. Terminology, structure, occurrence and development of the jaws are briefly reviewed. Special attention has been paid to the jaws of Eunicida including extinct and extant forms. Conflicting theories about the evolution of the jaws in Eunicida are discussed. The epithelia of the intestine may form a pseudostratified epithelium composed of glandular cells, absorptive cells and ciliated cells or only one cell type having similar functions. A conspicuous feature in the intestine of certain polychaetes is the occurrence of unicellular tubular structures, called enteronephridia.

The development of holothurians was interrupted at the stage of five primary tentacles. It resulted in changing of the mode of metamorphosis. The catastrophic metamorphosis became evol.: the body of an adult organism became to develop based on the body of larva, and the larval tissues were partly included in the body of an adult holothurian. The body of holothurian larva became partially included in the body of adult organism. This process resulted in the modification of the place and way of radial complex organs origination and development and strengthening of the heterochrony processes. All this led to the formation of the holothurian body plan. Data presented support the homology between the radial ambulacral canals of sea cucumbers and other Eleutherozoa.},

	abstract = {Previous phylogenetic attempts at resolving barnacle evolutionary relationships are few and have relied on limited taxon sampling. Here we combine DNA sequences from three nuclear genes (18S, 28S and H3) and 44 morphological characters collected from 76 thoracican (ingroup) and 15 rhizocephalan (outgroup) species representing almost all the Thoracica families to assess the tempo and mode of barnacle evolution. Using phylogenetic methods of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference and 14 fossil calibrations, we found that: (1) Iblomorpha form a monophyletic group; (2) pedunculated barnacles without shell plates (Heteralepadomorpha) are not ancestral, but have evolved, at least twice, from plated forms; (3) the ontogenetic pattern with 5 → 6 → 8 → 12+ plates does not reflect Thoracica shell evolution; (4) the traditional asymmetric barnacles (Verrucidae) and the Balanomorpha are each monophyletic and together they form a monophyletic group; (5) asymmetry and loss of a peduncle have evolved twice in the Thoracica, resulting in neither the Verrucomorpha nor the Sessilia forming monophyletic groups in their present definitions; (6) the Scalpellomorpha are not monophyletic; (7) the Thoracica suborders evolved since the Early Carboniferous (340 mya) with the final radiation of the Sessilia in the Upper Jurassic (147 mya). These results, therefore, reject many of the underlying hypotheses about character evolution in the Cirripedia Thoracica, stimulate a variety of new thoughts on thoracican radiation, and suggest the need for a major rearrangement in thoracican classification based on estimated phylogenetic relationships. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The Extraxial- Axial Theory shows that echinoderms also have an anterior/posterior (A/P) axis developed independently and ontogenetically before radiality. The A/P axis is first established via coelomic stacking in the extraxial region, with ensuing development of the pentamerous hydrocoel in the axial region. This is strongly correlated with a variety of gene expression patterns. The echinoid Hox cluster is disordered into two different sets of genes. During embryogenesis, members of the posterior class demonstrate temporal, spatial, and genetic colinearity within the extraxial region.We suggest that displacement of genes from the more anterior Hox classes toward the 5 end of the chromosome leads to control of the later-developing, radially symmetric axial region. Genetic disorder is therefore another way of using colinearity to build the unique echinoderm symmetry.},

These unanticipated phenomena are named chromothripsis, chromoanasynthesis and chromoplexy, and are grouped under the term of chromoanagenesis. As mechanisms for rapid and profound genome modifications in germlines and early development, these processes can be regarded as credible pathways for genomic evolution and speciation process. Their discovery confirms the importance of genome-centric investigations to fully understand organismal evolution. Because they oppose the model of progressive acquisition of driver mutations or rearrangements, these phenomena conceptually give support to the concept of macroevolution, known through the models of "Hopeful Monsters" and the "Punctuated Equilibrium". In this review, we summarize mechanisms underlying chromoanagenesis processes and we show that numerous cases of chromosomal speciation and short-term adaptation could be correlated to chromoanagenesis-related mechanisms. In the frame of a modern and integrative analysis of eukaryote evolutionary processes, it seems important to consider the unexpected chromoanagenesis phenomena.},

	abstract = {The egg of the polychaete Chætopterus, like many spiralian embryos, undergoes unequal cleavage during the first two cell divisions following fertilization. The first cleavage gives rise to a large CD blastomere and a smaller AB blastomere. At second cleavage the CD blastomere divides asymmetrically, forming a large D blastomere and a smaller C blastomere while the AB cell divides to give rise to the two smaller blastomeres, A and B, which are virtually identical in size. As in many of the other spiralians which have been studied, the A, B, C, and D blastomeres give rise to characteristic portions of the larval body plan. It has been shown in these related forms that the D blastomere derivatives are necessary for the production of various structures derived from the remaining three quadrants, as well as in organizing the overall symmetry properties of the embryo. If Chætopterus embryos are compressed underneath a coverslip at the appropriate stage of development prior to first cleavage (the "pear stage") some of the embryos divide to form two equal sized blastomeres. Each of the two cells in equalized embryos appears to develop as a normal CD blastomere often dividing to generate a four-celled embryo with two C and two D blastomeres opposite one another (CDCD embryos). These embryos often grow up to form larvae which have duplicated structures. We investigated the role of the early cleavage program in the production of double larvae by staining individual blastomeres of normal and equalized embryos with Nile blue sulfate. Our results reveal that previous descriptions of the symmetry properties of twinned larvae are incorrect. Twins are not true Janus larvae of the duplicitus cruciata form but are organized along a single axis. The two halves face one another along a plane of mirror symmetry, each one fused to the other at their ventral surface just above a single, common, fused mouth. Furthermore, the median plane of the two fused heads is the same as that of the two trunks. These labeling studies indicate that cells derived from both of the two C blastomeres in compressed embyos contribute to the formation of similar structures in both halves of the double larva. The two C quadrants within the double embryos each can give rise to two eyes, and the plane of mirror symmetry between the two halves of the double embryo as mentioned above corresponds to a plane running through the two C blastomeres in the fourcelled CDCD embryo. These findings indicate that the two D quadrants in these double embryos interact to organize the development of the double embryo in a coordinating manner. Both D quadrants, therefore, appear to be inductively active within the CDCD double embryos. These results are discussed in view of various hypotheses which have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of twinning in spiralians. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

Our present work focused on the freshwater annelid Aeolosoma viride , which reproduces by paratonic fission and is capable of complete regeneration. We found out that A. viride can regenerate both anterior and posterior end, even with only 3 segments remained. This process is characterized by epimorphosis that involves large amount of cell proliferation which drives the formation of blastema. Cell proliferation and regeneration successful ratio were significantly decreased when treated with microtubule inhibitor taxol or Avi-tubulin dsRNA, which confirmed that cell proliferation served as a key event during regeneration. Together, our data described the regenerative processes of A. viride , which includes high level of cell proliferation and the formation of blastema.

However, despite the "obvious" case for novelty, defining this concept in evolutionary terms is highly problematic, so much so that some have suggested discarding it altogether. Approaches to this problem tend to take either an adaptation- or development-based perspective, but we argue here that an exclusive focus on either of these misses the original intent of the novelty concept and undermines its practical utility. We propose instead that for a feature to be novel, it must have evolved both by a transition between adaptive peaks on the fitness landscape and that this transition must have overcome a previous developmental constraint. This definition focuses novelty on the explanation of apparently difficult or low-probability evolutionary transitions and highlights how the integration of developmental and functional considerations are necessary to evolutionary explanation. It further reinforces that novelty is a central concern not just of evolutionary developmental biology (i.e., "evo-devo") but of evolutionary biology more generally. We explore this definition of novelty in light of four examples that range from the obvious to subtle. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The concept in the modern literature dates to Simpson (1944), who used 'evolutionary inertia' as a description of pattern in the fossil record. Wilson (1975) used 'phylogenetic inertia' to describe population-level or organismal properties that can affect the course of evolution in response to selection. Many current authors now view phylogenetic inertia as an alternative hypothesis to adaptation by natural selection when attempting to explain interspecific variation, covariation or lack thereof in phenotypic traits. Some phylogenetic comparative methods have been claimed to allow quantification and testing of phylogenetic inertia. Although some existing methods do allow valid tests of whether related species tend to resemble each other, which we term 'phylogenetic signal', this is simply pattern recognition and does not imply any underlying process. Moreover, comparative data sets generally do not include information that would allow rigorous inferences concerning causal processes underlying such patterns. The concept of phylogenetic inertia needs to be defined and studied with as much care as 'adaptation'.},

After tracing the history of the concept of 'inertia' in evolutionary biology, I argue that treating phylogenetic inertia and natural selection as alternative explanations is mistaken because phylogenetic inertia is, from a Darwinian point of view, simply an expected effect of selection.

Here we study representatives of Xenacoelomorpha, Rotifera, Nemertea, Brachiopoda, and Annelida to assess the conservation of the dorsoventral nerve cord patterning. None of the studied species show a conserved dorsoventral molecular regionalization of their nerve cords, not even the annelid Owenia fusiformis, whose trunk neuroanatomy parallels that of vertebrates and flies. Our findings restrict the use of molecular patterns to explain nervous system evolution, and suggest that the similarities in dorsoventral patterning and trunk neuroanatomies evolved independently in Bilateria.},

	abstract = {In Annelida, as well as in other invertebrate taxa, the nervous system is considered to be a very conservative organ system. Immunohistochemical investigations [use of anti-5-HT (serotonin), FMRFamide, and acetylated α-tubulin antibodies] in combination with laser scanning microscopy enable more detailed reanalyses of known structures and detection of new characteristics that are useful for phylogenetic analyses. One hypothesis enabled by such studies is outlined for the evolution of arrangements of the dorsal circumesophageal roots in polychaetes and oligochaetes. These roots are not a unique feature of polychaetes; they also occur in oligochaetes. According to the Articulata hypothesis of metazoan relationships, the specific structure of the rope-ladder-like nervous system is, among others, an autapomorphic characteristic that unifies Annelida and Arthropoda. Recent studies applying the techniques mentioned here, however, demonstrate that the annelidan bauchmark (central nervous system of the trunk), in contrast to the arthropod pattern, is highly variable in terms of the number and position of connectives and the number of commissures per segment. The variability of the neuronal architecture as well as a hypothesis on how it evolved will be introduced with the aid of regeneration and developmental studies. Furthermore, it is shown that hitherto unknown nerves are present in the peripheral nervous system. © The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology 2006. All rights reserved.},

The egg cleavage results in a pattern of cellular contacts on the surface of each blastomere and whole embryo, a discrete morphogenetic field. We find topological distinctions between different types of early egg cleavage and suggest a topological classification of cleavage. Blastulation and gastrulation may be related to an inevitable emergence of discrete curvature that directs development in three-dimensional space. The relationship between local and global orders in metazoan development, i.e., between local morphogenetic processes and integral developmental patterns, is established.

Current studies of genome evolution often mistakenly focus only on the inheritance of DNA between parent and offspring. These are in line with the widely accepted Neo-Darwinian framework that pairs Mendelian genetics with an emphasis on natural selection as explanations for the evolution of biodiversity on Earth. Increasing evidence for widespread symbioses complicates this narrative, as is seen in Scott Gilbert's discussion of the concept of the holobiont in this series: Organisms across the tree of life coexist with substantial influence on one another through endosymbiosis, symbioses, and host-associated microbiomes. The holobiont theory, coupled with observations from molecular studies, also requires us to understand genomes in a new way—by considering the interactions underlain by the genome of a host plus its associated microbes, a conglomerate entity referred to as the hologenome. We argue that the complex patterns of inheritance of these genomes coupled with the influence of symbionts on host gene expression make the concept of the hologenome an epigenetic phenomenon. We further argue that the aspects of the hologenome challenge of the modern evolutionary synthesis, which requires updating to remain consistent with Darwin's intent of providing natural laws that underlie the evolution of life on Earth.},

	abstract = {An emergent property of an entity is one that results from the organization or interaction of its components. Here I argue that modularity (discreteness) is a universal emergent property of organismic traits that results from the universal bounded responsiveness, to inputs (e.g., genomic or environmental), of the phenotype at all levels of organization. While degree of modularity is variable and may be subject to change under selection, I argue that the consequences of modularity, such as the evolvability of modular traits (e.g., due to their somewhat independent expression and selection; and their potential for expression in new combinations) are not responsible for the existence of modularity itself. I discuss some other views of modularity in biology; and the related idea that increased complexity (e.g., increased numbers of kinds of modular traits) is a product of selection. I argue that emergent properties characterize innovative phenotypes at their origin. When emergent properties occur at more than one level of phenotypic organization, they sometimes lead to confusion due to confounding levels of organization with levels of selection, as has occurred in discussions of group selection in the evolution of sociality. Phenotypes, whose environmental sensitivity and (emergent) properties are emphasized here, seem likely to assume increasing importance as biology moves toward a better understanding of the genome as agent of both the transmission and the expression of traits.},

Using the notion of the holobiont life cycle, this paper attempts to show that these evolutionary transitions can be accomplished through various means of symbiosis. Perceiving the organism both as an interspecies consortium and as a life cycle supports a twofold redefinition of the organism as a holobiont constructed by integrating together the life cycles of several species.

By contextualizing his framework within two decades of theorizing about major transitions in evolution, we identify some basic problems that Bonner's theory shares with much of the prevailing literature. These problems include implicit progressivism, theoretical disunity, and a limited ability to explain major evolutionary transformations. We go on to identify events and processes that are neglected by existing views. In contrast with the “vertical” focus on replication, hierarchy, and morphology that preoccupies most of the literature on major transitions, we propose a “horizontal” dimension in which metabolism and microbial innovations play a central explanatory role in understanding the broad-scale organization of life.},

The elements of his postulated nonuniformitarianism in the essay under discussion—the emergence of sex, the enhanced selection pressures on larger multicellular forms—center on a presumed close mapping of genotypic to phenotypic change. A different view emerges from delving into earlier work of Bonner's in which he proposed the concept of “neutral phenotypes” and “neutral morphologies” allied to D’Arcy Thompson's analysis of physical determinants of form and studied the conditional elicitation of intrinsic organizational properties of cell aggregates in social amoebae. By comparing the shared and disparate mechanistic bases of morphogenesis and developmental outcomes in the embryos of metazoans (animals), closely related nonmetazoan holozoans, more distantly related dictyostelids, and very distantly related volvocine algae, I conclude, in agreement with Bonner's earlier proposals, that understanding the evolution of multicellular evolution requires knowledge of the inherent forms of diversifying lineages, and that the relevant causative factors extend beyond genes and adaptation to the physics of materials.},

	abstract = {John Bonner pointed out that microorganisms differ in several ways, some of which may reflect neutral phenotypic evolution. For making his case, Bonner referred to interspecies differences and morphological traits. Here we consider intraspecies differences and physiological traits. As a case-study, we examine the production of an extracellular cyclic 3 (Formula presented.), 5 (Formula presented.) monophosphate phosphodiesterase in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Temporal profiles of phosphodiesterase activity differ significantly between wild-type strains. From that we argue that the inference drawn initially from studies on a single wild-type, namely that the profile displayed by it pointed to an adaptive role, was mistaken. We generalize the conclusion to suggest that physiological differences exhibited by microorganisms of the same species may, but need not, reflect adaptations to different environments. Rather, the differences could be related to the fact that microorganisms live in groups whose composition can vary between homogeneous (clonal) and heterogeneous (polyclonal). More than one physiological profile is consistent with the normal development of the group in a given environment; the alternatives are neutral. When studying microbial physiology and behavior, it is expected that the observations are made on a clonal population; genetic (and so phenotypic) heterogeneity is carefully guarded against. As the example from D. discoideum shows, an unintended consequence of overlooking phenotypic heterogeneity is that one can fall into the trap of accepting a seemingly plausible, but possibly erroneous, adaptive explanation for a “normal” wild-type phenotype.},

	abstract = {The consequences of population bottlenecks for dental phenotypes are studied in Arvicolinae, a subfamily of cricetid rodents widely used as a proxy of environmental change and an index group for relative dating and correlation of the Quaternary deposits throughout the Holarctic. Comparative morphological analysis reveals similar phenotypic shifts in populations of extant Dicrostonyx, Lemmus, Myopus, Microtus surviving bottlenecks in captivity or in the areas favouring genetic drift (coastal zones and islands, patchy landscapes in the mountainous areas, declining peripheral populations). Six to ten founders is enough for an isolated population to reproduce the full range of species-specific variability in fitness-related characters (crown complexity and occlusal regularity) during the first two generations, while the average values of both characters exhibit founder dependence. When lasting longer than 3 generations, bottlenecks increase diversity owing to 1) the accumulation of rare traits of complexity and regularity inherited from the founders and 2) inbreeding impacts (the loss of advanced morphology and appearance of extra elements in places of the lophs and cusplets of an ancestral cricetid molar). Founder-related and inbreeding-induced simplifications of dentition might potentially lead to biochronological discrepancies in the fossil record of Arvicolinae. To detect possible biases in biochronological data, the phenotypic markers of close breeding are identified. Application of the results to the fossil record of collared lemmings from the north of West Siberia allows hypothesising the periods of increased genetic drift in the ancestral forms of Dicrostonyx in the late Middle Pleistocene and in the early Late Pleistocene.},

	abstract = {The cnidosac has been investigated in 14 species of Aeolidoidea from the Gulf of Naples and from Roscoff with the light microscope and in one species, Cratena peregrina, with the electron microscope. The morphology of the entodermal cnidosac is similar in all species. The cnidosac is more or less an ellipsoid or spindle shaped organ, which is connected with an open pore or a narrow duct with the hepatopancreas - and which is always closed at its distal end. A permanent, epithelial cnidopore was not observed. The single-layered epithelium of the cnidosac is mainly composed of nematophages (= cnidophages). At the entrance of the cnidosac and at its distal end there often occurs a zone of undifferentiated cells, believed to serve for regeneration of lost cnidophages. The cnidophages phagocytize cnidocysts (nematocysts) and may store it for a long time. The nematocyst and the nematophag remain intact, whereas the nematocyt always becomes digested. The nematophages are characterized by large mitochondria, large golgi complexes, by a basal labyrinth, an active nucleus with a large nucleolus and by vacuoles containing tubular bodies. Pericaryell, a week rough endoplasmic reticulum, is found while in the apical cell region the endoplasmic reticulum is smooth and appears "empty". The nematocysts possess an intact fine structure and lie within a vacuole. The unit membrane of the vacuole encloses the nematocyst very closely. The arrangement of the cnidocysts within the cnidophages is species-specific, p.e. the nematocysts lie parallel to one another in Aeolodia papillosa, while they are arranged in a "circle" in Trinchesia ilonae or like a bouquet in Trinchesia granosa. Within the cnidophage the cnidocysts are stored unexploded and remain functional for a long time. Many species store only certain types of nematocysts of the cnidom of the hydroid. The mechanism of this selection is unknown. When the nematocysts are ejected the epidermis and the epithelium of the cnidosac burst at a preformed zone. This region is characterized by being very high and slender, but otherwise "normal" epidermal cells and often by undifferentiated nematophages. Muscles are absent in this region. The nematocysts are ejected within the nematophages. The cell membrane bursts only in the sea water and the cnidocysts explode. The cleft is closed by contraction, which bring the epidermal cells of the wound border and the undifferentiated cells of the cnidosac epithelium close together. The nematocysts are usually ejected only on appropriate violent mechanical stimulation. A slow, continuous ejection lasting for several days or a spontanuous, repeated ejection as a natural modus of excretion have never been observed. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.},

	doi = {10.1006/jtbi.2001.2423},
	abstract = {The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of evolution typically assumes that the set of possible phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular space equipped with a notion of distance, for example, a Euclidean vector space. Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype-phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution - such as punctuation, irreversibility, modularity - result naturally from the properties of this space. The classical framework, however, addresses these patterns by exclusively invoking natural selection on suitably imposed fitness landscapes. We propose to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the genotype-phenotype map. We introduce the mathematical concepts and tools necessary to formalize the notion of accessibility pre-topology relative to which we can speak of continuity in the genotype-phenotype map and in evolutionary trajectories. We connect the factorization of a pre-topology into a product space with the notion of phenotypic character and derive a condition for factorization. Based on anecdotal evidence from the RNA model, we conjecture that this condition is not globally fulfilled, but rather confined to regions where the genotype-phenotype map is continuous. Equivalently, local regions of genotype space on which the map is discontinuous are associated with the loss of character autonomy. This is consistent with the importance of these regions for phenotypic innovation. The intention of the present paper is to offer a perspective, a framework to implement this perspective, and a few results illustrating how this framework can be put to work. The RNA case is used as an example throughout the text. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The spiral cleavage pattern is characteristic for Spiralia (Lophotrochozoa), a large assembly of marine invertebrates. In most cases, spiral cleavage produces freely swimming, trochophora-type larvae with a simple nervous system that controls ciliary locomotion. These larvae acquire bilateral symmetry, as manifested for example in the larval brain. The transition from the rotational symmetry of spiral cleavage into the bilateral adult body has not yet been understood. Here, we present the developmental cell lineage of the brain of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii from the zygote until the mid-trochophore stage ({\textasciitilde}30 hpf), in combination with a gene expression atlas for several embryonic and larval stages. Comparison of multiple embryos reveals a highly stereotypical development and an invariant cell lineage of the differentiated cell types. In addition, we observe a fundamental subdivision of the larval brain into a highly proliferative dorsolateral region and an early differentiating ventromedial region that gives rise to the apical nervous system. The transition from rotational to bilateral symmetry progresses gradually from the lateral to the central regions. Strikingly, the spiral-to-bilateral transition does not involve extensive cell migration. Rather, corresponding cells in different spiral quadrants acquire highly divergent identities in line with their bilateral position.},

Specifically, I explore the roles of canalization, plasticity and threshold responses during development in generating a reservoir of cryptic genetic variation free to drift and accumulate in natural populations. Environmental or genetic perturbations that exceed the buffering capacity of development can then release this variation, and, through evolution by genetic accommodation, result in rapid diversification, recurrence of lost phenotypes as well as the origins of novel features. I conclude that, in our quest to understand the nature of innovation, the nature of development deserves to take center stage. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The modern synthesis, as an exclusive proposition, has broken down on both of its fundamental claims: extrapolationism (gradual allelic substitution as a model for all evolutionary change) and nearly exclusive reliance on selection leading to adaptation. Evolution is a hierarchical process with complementary, but different, modes of change at its three major levels: variation within populations, speciation, and patterns of macroevolution. Speciation is not always an extension of gradual, adaptive allelic substitution to greater effect, but may represent, as Goldschmidt argued, a different style of genetic change-rapid reorganization of the genome, perhaps non-adaptive. Macroevolutionary trends do not arise from the gradual, adaptive transformation of populations, but usually from a higher-order selection operating upon groups of species, while the individual species themselves generally do not change following their geologically instantaneous origin. I refer to these two discontinuities in the evolutionary hierarchy as the Goldschmidt break (between change in populations and speciation) and the Wright break (between speciation and trends as differential success among species). A new and general evolutionary theory will embody this notion of hierarchy and stress a variety of themes either ignored or explicitly rejected by the modern synthesis: punctuational change at all levels, important non-adaptive change at all levels, control of evolution not only by selection, but equally by constraints of history, development and architecture-thus restoring to evolutionary theory a concept of organism. © 1980, Paleontological Society.

	abstract = {Big Brother, the tyrant of George Orwell's 1984, directed his daily Two Minutes Hate against Emmanuel Goldstein, enemy of the people. When I studied evolutionary biology in graduate school during the mid-1960s, official rebuke and derision focused upon Richard Goldschmidt, a famous geneticist who, we were told, had gone astray. Although 1984 creeps up on us, I trust that the world will not be in Big Brother's grip by then. I do, however, predict that during this decade Goldschmidt will be largely vindicated in the world of evolutionary biology. Goldschmidt, a Jewish refugee from Hitler's decimation of German science, spent the remainder of his career at Berkeley, where he died in 1958. His views on evolution ran afoul of the great neo-Darwinian synthesis forged during the 1930s and 1940s and continuing today as a reigning, if insecure, orthodoxy. Contemporary neo-Darwinism is often called the "synthetic theory of evolution" because it united the theories of population genetics with the classical observations of morphology, systematics, embryology, biogeography, and paleontology. The core of this synthetic theory restates the two most characteristic assertions of Darwin himself: first, that evolution is a two-stage process (random variation as raw material, natural selection as a directing force); secondly, that evolutionary change is generally slow, steady, gradual, and continuous. Geneticists can study the gradual increase of favored genes within populations of fruit flies in laboratory bottles. Naturalists can record the steady replacement of light moths by dark moths as industrial soot blackens the trees of Britain. Orthodox neo-Darwinians extrapolate these even and continuous changes to the most profound structural transitions in the history of life: by a long series of insensibly graded intermediate steps, birds are linked to reptiles, fish with jaws to their jawless ancestors. Macroevolution (major structural transition) is nothing more than microevolution (flies in bottles) extended. If black moths can displace white moths in a century, then reptiles can become birds in a few million years by the smooth and sequential summation of countless changes. The shift of gene frequencies in local populations is an adequate model for all evolutionary processes—or so the current orthodoxy states. The most sophisticated of modern American textbooks for introductory biology expresses its allegiance to the conventional view in this way:},

We found that local species richness and abundance typically peaked at higher latitudes, displaying patterns opposite to those observed in aboveground organisms. However, high species dissimilarity across tropical locations may cause diversity across the entirety of the tropics to be higher than elsewhere. Climate variables were found to be more important in shaping earthworm communities than soil properties or habitat cover.

These hypotheses either call for a common ancestor already provided with patterned appendages or body outgrowths, or for the recruitment in limb patterning of single genes or genetic cassettes originally used for purposes other than axis patterning. I suggest instead that body appendages such as arthropod and vertebrate limbs and chordate tails are evolutionarily divergent duplicates (paramorphs) of the main body axis, that is, its duplicates, albeit devoid of endodermal component. Thus, vertebrate limbs and arthropod limbs are not historical homologs, but homoplastic features only transitively related to real historical homologs. Thus, the main body axis and the axis of the appendages have distinct but not independent evolutionary histories and may be involved in processes of homeotic co-option producing effects of morphological assimilation. For instance, chordate segmentation may have originated in the posterior appendage (tail) and subsequently extended to the trunk.},

Concluye que los todos los órganos se dividen y que cada cordón nervioso se divide en dos (dibujo) tal y como creíamos. Compara este hecho con la existencia de Syllis ramosa, y habla de que la regeneración podría estar en el origen de estas dos condiciones.Un caso de duplicación parcial en Lumbriculus variegatus y gemación en Syllis ramosa.En Syllis ramosa, la peculiar forma anneloide que vive en el Canalwerk de Spongien, existe, por adaptación al lugar de residencia, una forma de propagación que hasta ahora ha sido exclusiva de los anélidos. Mientras que en los anélidos se produce un aumento del individuo de forma asexual, generalmente de tal manera que los animales con o sin zonas de regeneración simplemente se rompen en pedazos, que en un caso son prematuros (Nais), en el otro caso posteriores (Ctenodrilus , Lumbriculus) en individuos completos, las zonas de regeneración en Syllis ramosa proporcionan ramas laterales, eventualmente creando una caña de gusano muy ramificada. M'Intosh (1. c.), Quien describió a estos animales descubiertos por la Expedición Challenger, indica que retirar un palo de gusano de las esponjas implica grandes dificultades y que, por lo tanto, no es fácil decidir si Wurmstock posee una o varias cabezas. Si entiendo bien a M'Intosh, tiende a la visión anterior. Sin embargo, su descripción de los puntos en ciernes se refiere principalmente a la forma del cuerpo externo y, por lo tanto, echamos de menos la información que se refiere a la anatomía interna de estas regiones del cuerpo.Recogiendo Lumbriculus para otro examen, encontré un animal cuyo cuerpo estaba bifurcado a medio camino en dos ramas. Esta anormalidad, que inmediatamente nos recordó las condiciones de Syllis ramosa cuando la vemos, es de interés múltiple y, por lo tanto, se discutirá brevemente a continuación.En la Figura 1 del panel adjunto, el animal se muestra ampliado. Se puede ver que los dos extremos posteriores, que tienen zonas de florecimiento, tienen casi la misma longitud. La derecha más débil es al mismo tiempo un poco más larga.Mientras este gusano se moviera en los tallos de Hypnum fluidans, que se producen en grandes cantidades en la localidad local del lumbriculus, la anomalía se habría pasado por alto fácilmente. Pero cuando el extraño animal llegó a acostarse en el piso plano de un recipiente de vidrio, trajo sus partes individuales a la posición que se muestra en el panel adjunto. Si uno ahora se irrita con pinchazos en el extremo frontal, la reacción tuvo lugar en forma de un fuerte retroceso de los dos extremos posteriores de la misma manera y al mismo tiempo. De esto se pudo ver que las vías nerviosas tenían que estar igualmente bien formadas en los dos extremos. Se sabe que los movimientos de natación de un gusano en el agua ocurren por flexiones ondulantes del cuerpo. En el animal presente, el movimiento ondulatorio de la parte delantera del cuerpo en la punta del tenedor continuó uniformemente y en la misma dirección hacia los extremos posteriores.Ahora pasemos a la inspección de la estructura anatómica de la horquilla. Ya externamente, podemos concluir por el curso de los límites del segmento (Fig. 2) en la forma en que se efectúa la bifurcación. Resulta, a saber, que en el sitio de división del cuerpo del gusano hay un segmento que se conecta a tres segmentos, de tal manera que el extremo anterior de este segmento contacta con el último metamer del cuerpo frontal del gusano, el extremo posterior del discurso Sin embargo, el segmento de pie tiene dos superficies de contacto para los primeros segmentos respectivos de las dos ramas de la horquilla.Con respecto a los órganos típicos de este segmento, se puede ver en las figuras 2 y 3 que tanto los vasos sanguíneos dorsales como ventrales, así como el intestino y la médula abdominal, el tenedor. El vaso dorsal poseía, como en otros segmentos, un par de vellosidades de vasos ramificados. Por otro lado, en el primer segmento de la horquilla izquierda, perdemos una vellosidad vascular en el lado derecho del vaso dorsal.Según la manera en que los dos primeros segmentos (42 S 'y 42 S "Eig. 2) de los extremos finales y el último segmento (40 S) del extremo delantero se comunican con el metamer (41 S) ubicado en el sitio de asentamiento , los órganos segmentarios también se formaron. Dos embudos perforaron el dispositivo 41 D (figura 2) y cuatro embudos perforaron los dispositivos 42 D 'y 42 D En la figura 2, no se introdujeron los órganos segmentarios.El examen del objeto vivo tuvo que llevarse a cabo lo antes posible para exponer al animal a una narcosis no demasiado larga y a una presión no presionable del cubreobjetos, ya que debía preservarse en una condición adecuada para su posterior conservación. Los vacíos inevitables por la rápida investigación se llenaron con el estudio de una serie de cortes realizados en dirección horizontal a través del timón del animal. Esta brecha afectó particularmente al estómago. Como ya se mencionó, era de esperar desde el principio que un cordón abdominal bien formado tuviera que estar presente en las dos piezas de la horquilla. La figura 3, que muestra una sección horizontal a través del animal al nivel de los tres neurocordatos, muestra que las piezas de horquilla de este último se ubican nuevamente en los lados idénticos del cuerpo en los extremos posteriores. Por lo tanto, el neurocordio A suministra los neurocordatos a1 y a2 que se ejecutan en el lado izquierdo del cuerpo, el neurocordio C se bifurca en el derecho c1 y c2, y el centro B se divide en los dos neurocordatos de la línea media b1 y b2.En una comunicación anterior (1º c.) Ya aproveché la oportunidad para señalar la importancia de las anomalías segmentarias que se producen en los anélidos, que hasta ahora no se habían considerado en la literatura. Además, el presente caso se llama anormal. Un similar pero no a este grado de bifurcación de la parte trasera floreció Claparede de una Salmacina incrustans representada, pero sin describirlo con más detalle. La bifurcación se extendió a través de siete segmentos en este animal. Él llama a este fenómeno una monstruosidad, lo cual es raro en los anélidos. Es de destacar que, como se muestra en la figura en cuestión, seis segmentos de conmutación estaban presentes entre los dos extremos posteriores.En esta ocasión, me gustaría mencionar que unos meses después de la publicación de mi artículo mencionado anteriormente e independientemente de mí mismo, T.H. Morgan describió anomalías de segmentación en la lombriz de tierra. Él vino aquí a las mismas opiniones sobre el origen de anomalías como yo.Inspirada en mi publicación (1d c.), Florence Buclianan, aún no consciente del trabajo de Morgan, ha sometido recientemente a la colección Annelid del Museo Británico a una revisión de especímenes con segmentos anómalos. En la abundancia de material de estudio disponible para él, fue capaz de multiplicar el número de anomalías segmentarias por muchas e interesantes. Sí, ha llegado a creer que estos fenómenos son tan comunes que es probable que los llame anormalidades. Por lo tanto, en ciertos anélidos, normalmente habría una relación similar a la encontrada en las nemertinas, en las que se encuentran formas de segmentación regular e irregular. En relación con las peculiaridades de los últimos animales, ya he señalado las anomalías de la segmentación en los anélidos, y he sugerido que tales formas anéloides con segmentación irregular cierran la brecha entre las nemertinas y los anélidos con respecto a la disposición irregular y regular de los metaméricos. pude. Buclianan no encontró casos de bifurcación trasera.Pero no solo en las vértebras, sino también en los vertebrados (salamandra y axolotl), a veces hay bifurcaciones de la cola y formaciones dobles de extremidades, siempre después de la regeneración de estas partes perdidas.A la aparición de la bifurcación actual de la parte traseraPara explicar en Lumbriculus, debemos suponer que las dos líneas germinales de la zona de regeneración que abastecen a los segmentos, cada una con su propia porción de ectodermo y endodermo, fueron capaces de producir metamers completos. Como causa directa, puede haber habido una lesión que estimuló la capacidad regenerativa de estos animales, que en sí misma era muy activa, a una actividad aún mayor, y condujo, como en los anfibios citados, a la bifurcación del extremo posterior.En vista del caso descrito en el presente caso, se considerarán los resultados obtenidos por las investigaciones experimentales de Driesch, Hertwig, Roux, Wilson y otros. A., en la formación de medio embrión y su regeneración a embriones enteros. Y no se puede negar que los fenómenos discutidos aquí en Syllis ramosa y en el caso de Lumbriculus con esos fenómenos en la regeneración de semiembriones para completar características comunes. Por esta razón, también, la apariencia anormal de Lumbriculus y la referencia a los eventos relacionados en Syllis ramosa me pareció que valía la pena.},

	abstract = {Symmetry is appealing, be it in architecture, art or facial expression, where symmetry is a key feature to finding someone attractive or not. Yet, asymmetries are widespread in nature, not as an erroneous deviation from the norm but as a way to adapt to the prevailing environmental conditions at a time. Asymmetries in many cases are actively selected for: they might well have increased the evolutionary fitness of a species. Even many single-celled organisms are built asymmetrically, such as the pear-shaped ciliate Paramecium, which may depend on its asymmetry to navigate towards the oxygen-richer surface of turbid waters, at least based on modeling. Everybody knows the lobster with its asymmetric pair of claws, the large crusher usually on the left and the smaller cutter on the right. Snail shells coil asymmetrically, as do the organs they house. Organ asymmetries are found throughout the animal kingdom, referring to asymmetric positioning, asymmetric morphology or both, with the vertebrate heart being an example for the latter. Functional asymmetries, such as that of the human brain with its localization of the language center in one hemisphere, add to the complexity of organ asymmetries and presumably played a decisive role for sociocultural evolution. The evolutionary origin of organ asymmetries may have been a longer than body length gut, which allows efficient retrieval of nutrients, and the need to stow a long gut in the body cavity in an orderly manner that ensures optimal functioning. Vertebrate organ asymmetries (situs solitus) are quite sophisticated: in humans, the apex of the asymmetrically built heart points to the left; the lung in turn, due to space restrictions, has fewer lobes on the left than on the right side (two versus three in humans), stomach and spleen are found on the left, the liver on the right, and small and large intestine coil in a chiral manner (Figure 1A). In very rare cases (1:10,000), the organ situs is inverted (situs inversus), while heterotaxia refers to another rare situation (about 1:1,000), in which subsets of organs show normal or aberrant positioning or morphology (Figure 1B). Individuals with situs solitus or situs inversus are healthy, whereas heterotaxia presents severe congenital malformations. Many human syndromes are known in which patients suffer from laterality defects, such as Katagener syndrome, in which the organ situs is inverted in one half of patients and males are sterile. Snail shells and vertebrate organs are examples of biased asymmetries with on average only one inversion in every 10,000 cases. Other asymmetries such as the coiling of the tails of piglets occur randomly with a 50:50 distribution. This primer exclusively deals with organ asymmetries in the animal kingdom, specifically with the mechanisms that ensure the development of biased asymmetries during embryogenesis.

Toroidal membranes are occasionally observed, e.g., in specialized structures of plant cells like the prolamellar body. Here, we propose that rules analogous to those that govern the topology of biomembranes hold for the epithelial cell sheets that cover anatomically external as well as internal surfaces of multicellular animals.

By this means metazoan morphogenesis may be represented as topological modification(s) of the epithelial surfaces of an animal body. The animal body surface is an interface between an organism and its environment, and topological transformations of the body surface during metazoan development and evolution results in better distribution of flows to and from the external medium, regarded as the source of nutrients and oxygen and the sink of excreta, so ensuring greater metabolic intensity. In sponges and some Cnidaria, the increase of this genus up to high values and the shaping of topologically complicated fractal-like systems are evident. In most Bilateria, a stable topological pattern with a through digestive tube is formed, and the subsequent topological complications of other systems can also appear. The present paper provides a topological interpretation of some developmental events through the use of well-known mathematical concepts and theorems; the relationship between local and global orders in metazoan development, i.e., between local morphogenetic processes and integral developmental patterns, is established.

Topological singularities inevitably arising and transforming during early development destroy the preexisting pattern of symmetry. The symmetry breaking of preexisting spatial pattern plays a critical role in biological morphogenesis in development and evolution. Some events of early development are interpreted in terms of symmetry breakdown and related to well-known mathematical theorems. A topological inevitability of some developmental events through the use of classical topological concepts is discussed. The topological approach makes it possible to consider the succession of spherical surgeries, which change the topological genus of an animal body surface. We model the biological shape as a set of smooth, closed, oriented surfaces—membrane or epithelial layers. Membrane and epithelial surfaces are boundary layers, interfaces between a living structure and its environment, ensuring metabolism. Toroid forms as well as fractal structures in metazoans can be considered as functionally optimized biological design and attractors in biological morphogenesis. The epithelial surface is an interface between the internal medium of an organism and the outside environmental medium; topological and fractal transformations during metazoan evolution and development increase this interface, ensuring better adaptation of organism to the environment. Fractal structures as well as toroid forms can be considered as a functionally optimized design in Metazoa.

Only recently, a second species has been described [1], while the presence of more than a hundred additional species has been suggested [2]. The original placozoan species Trichoplax adhaerens [3], the second species Hoilungia hongkongensis [1] and all yet undescribed species are morphologically indistinguishable (i.e. no species diagnostic characters are available [4]). Here, we report on a new placozoan species, Polyplacotoma mediterranea gen. nov., spec. nov., which differs from other placozoans in its completely different morphological habitus, including long polytomous body branches and a maximum body length of more than 10 mm. Polyplacotoma mediterranea also necessitates a different view of placozoan mitochondrial genetics. P. mediterranea harbors a highly compact mitochondrial genome with overlapping mitochondrial tRNA and protein coding genes. Furthermore, the new species lacks typical placozoan features, including the cox1 micro exon and cox1 barcode intron. As phylogenetic analyses suggest a sister group relationship of P. mediterranea to all other placozoans, this new species may also be relevant for studies addressing the relationships at the base of the metazoan tree of life. Osigus et al. report on a new placozoan from the Mediterranean, with a unique ramified habitus and a highly compact mitogenome. Phylogenetic analyses support its sister-group relationship to formerly known placozoans, demanding the erection of the new genus Polyplacotoma and the description of the new species Polyplacotoma mediterranea.},

	abstract = {© The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2014. All rights reserved. Asymmetrical thoracican cirripedes of superfically similar 'verrucomorph' morphology are shown to have evolved independently three times from pedunculate ancestors. In each case, the loss of a peduncle was accompanied by preferential attachment on one side or the other, such that the rostrum, carina and one of each paired scuta and terga (fixed) formed a wall-like structure; the opposite scutum and tergum (free or moveable) transforming into an opercular lid closed by the scutal adductor muscle. True verrucomorphs (Eoverruca + Verrucidae) have their origin in the mid-Cretaceous sessile genera Pycnolepas and Faxelepas gen. nov., which demonstrate a marked, but facultative, tendency towards capitular asymmetry, confirmed by strong morphological similarities in plate morphology to the basal verrucomorph genus Eoverruca of Late Cretaceous age. Proverruca, another Late Cretaceous asymmetrical form, is not closely related; it evolved independently from a scalpelliform ancestor. The extant hydrothermal vent genera Neoverruca and Imbricaverruca evolved from symmetrical scalpelliforms of the family Neolepadidae, as demonstrated by both molecular and morphological evidence. Cladistic analysis of 38 characters in 14 living and fossil taxa has yielded a consensus tree showing a monophyletic Verrucomorpha, made up of a stem group (Eoverruca) and crown group (Verrucidae). Faxelepas bruennichi comb. nov. and Pycnolepas rigida are sister taxa to the Verrucomorpha, and evolved from a pedunculate ancestor. The Verrucidae are divided into a basal stem group (Altiverruca, Globosoverruca) and a derived crown group (all other genera). Within the crown group, the monophyletic Priscoverrucinae subfam. nov. is identified. Systematic revision of Cretaceous verrucomorphs and basal sessilians includes description of Pedupycnolepas gen. nov., Faxelepas gen. nov., Youngiverruca gen. nov. and Priscoverruca gen. nov. and two new species, Youngiverruca ruegenensis sp. nov. and Verruca jagti sp. nov.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) measurements are used in veterinary medicine for diagnosing growth hormone disorders. IGF-I assays are subject to interference by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) which may not be efficiently removed by standard extraction methods. Adding excess IGF-II during analysis may improve accuracy. OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study was to validate a commercial human IGF-I ELISA which uses excess IGF-II for feline samples and to evaluate biologic variation. METHODS Precision was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV). Accuracy was determined by recovery after removal of IGFBP, addition of IGF-I, and linear dilution after the addition of IGFBP. Biologic variation was determined by repeated sampling in 7 cats. RESULTS There was interference by IGFBP in the high measuring range, resulting in falsely low IGF-I concentrations. This was overcome by the addition of high concentrations of IGF-II. Untreated serum had a measured/expected ratio of 98-115\% compared to serum where IGFBP had been removed. Recovery after the addition of IGF-I was 83-112\%. Inter- and intra-assay CVs ranged from 2.4\% to 5.0\% which is within the minimum acceptance criteria based on biologic variation. The reference interval of IGF-I was wide (90-1207 ng/mL) and there was a significant association between body weight and ln IGF-I (P {\textless} .000001). CONCLUSIONS This human ELISA is suitable for feline samples, but interfering IGFBP can cause falsely low concentrations. It is recommended to dilute samples such that IGF-I is {\textless} 28 ng/mL on the standard curve to grant for sufficient IGF-II for binding of interferent IGFBP.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of asymmetry variation offer a powerful tool for exploring the interplay between ontogeny and evolution because (i) conspicuous asymmetries exist in many higher metazoans with widely varying modes of development, (ii) patterns of bilateral variation within species may identify genetically and environmentally triggered asymmetries, and (iii) asymmetries arising at different times during development may be more sensitive to internal cytoplasmic inhomogeneities compared to external environmental stimuli. Using four broadly comparable asymmetry states (symmetry, antisymmetry, dextral, and sinistral), and two stages at which asymmetry appears developmentally (larval and postlarval), I evaluated relations between ontogenetic and phylogenetic patterns of asymmetry variation. Among 140 inferred phylogenetic transitions between asymmetry states, recorded from 11 classes in five phyla, directional asymmetry (dextral or sinistral) evolved directly from symmetrical ancestors proportionally more frequently among larval asymmetries. In contrast, antisymmetry, either as an end state or as a transitional stage preceding directional asymmetry, was confined primarily to postlarval asymmetries. The ontogenetic origin of asymmetry thus significantly influences its subsequent evolution. Furthermore, because antisymmetry typically signals an environmentally triggered asymmetry, the phylogenetic transition from antisymmetry to directional asymmetry suggests that many cases of laterally fixed asymmetries evolved via genetic assimilation.},

Patterns of evolutionary changes in symmetry types and the homology of body axes across lineages are discussed here by confronting evidence from comparative anatomy, phylogeny, genomics and evo-devo. The conventional scenario, postulating a graded complexification from asymmetry to radial and finally bilateral symmetry, is considered untenable. Cylindrical symmetry is likely to be the ancestral type from which derived all remaining types through multiple convergences. Recent proposals prompted by molecular data that the bilateral anatomies of many cnidarians and of the Bilateria are homologous are clearly not supported. The Hox-based patterning system operating along the antero-posterior axis of the Bilateria does not seem to predate their divergence with the Cnidaria, but intercellular signalling systems, notably the Wnt pathway, could have been involved in generating the main body axis in the last common ancestor of the Metazoa.

	abstract = {Sponges establish tight associations with both micro- and macroorganisms. However, while studies on sponge microbiomes are numerous, nothing is currently known about the microbiomes of sponge-associated polychaetes and their relationships with those of their host sponges. We analyzed the bacterial communities of symbiotic polychaetes ( Haplosyllis spp.) and their host sponges ( Clathria reinwardti , Amphimedon paraviridis , Neofibularia hartmani , and Aaptos suberitoides ) to assess the influence of the sponges on the polychaete microbiomes. We identified both eukaryote partners by molecular (16S and COI genes) and morphological features, and we identified their microbial communities by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V4 region). We unravel the existence of six Haplosyllis species (five likely undescribed) associated at very high densities with the study sponge species in Nha Trang Bay (central Vietnam). A single polychaete species inhabited A. paraviridis and was different from the single species that inhabited A. suberitoides . Conversely, two different polychaete species were found in C. reinwardti and N. hartmani , depending on the two host locations. Regardless of the host sponge, polychaete microbiomes were species specific, which is a widespread feature in marine invertebrates. More than half of the polychaete bacteria were also found in the host sponge microbiome but at contrasting abundances. Thus, the associated polychaetes seemed to be able to select, incorporate, and enrich part of the sponge microbiome, a selection that appears to be polychaete species specific. Moreover, the bacterial diversity is similar in both eukaryotic partners, which additionally confirms the influence of food (host sponge) on the structure of the polychaete microbiome.  IMPORTANCE The symbiotic lifestyle represents a fundamental cryptic contribution to the diversity of marine ecosystems. Sponges are ideal targets to improve understanding the symbiotic relationships from evolutionary and ecological points of view, because they are the most ancient metazoans on earth, are ubiquitous in the marine benthos, and establish complex symbiosis with both prokaryotes and animals, which in turn also harbor their own bacterial communities. Here, we study the microbiomes of sponge-polychaete associations and confirm that polychaetes feed on their host sponges. The study worms select and enrich part of the sponge microbiome to shape their own species-specific bacterial communities. Moreover, worm microbiome diversity runs parallel to that of its food host sponge. Considering our results on symbiotic polychaetes and previous studies on fishes and mammals, diet appears to be an important source of bacteria for animals to shape their species-specific microbiomes.},

To overcome this, we investigated the complex leucon-type architecture in the demosponge Tethya wilhelma using corrosion casting, microtomography, and 3D reconstructions. Our integrative qualitative and quantitative approach allowed us to create, for the first time, high-resolution 3D representations of entire canal systems which were used for detailed geometric and morphometric measurements. Canal diameters lack distinct size classes, and bifurcations are non-uniformly ramified. A relatively high number of bifurcations show previously unknown and atypical cross-sectional area ratios. Scaling properties and topological patterns of the canals indicate a more complex overall architecture than previously assumed. As a consequence, it might be more convenient to group canals into functional units rather than hierarchical clusters. Our data qualify the leucon canal system architecture of T. wilhelma as a highly efficient fluid transport system adapted toward minimal flow resistance.

However, the precise evolutionary importance of bilateral symmetry is unknown, although elements of the understanding of the phenomenon have been present within the scientific community for decades. Presentation of the hypothesis: Here we show, with very simple physical laws, that locomotion in three-dimensional macro-world space is itself sufficient to explain the maintenance of bilateral symmetry in animal evolution. The ability to change direction, a key element of locomotion, requires the generation of instantaneous " pushing " surfaces, from which the animal can obtain the necessary force to depart in the new direction. We show that bilateral is the only type of symmetry that can maximize this force; thus, an actively locomoting bilateral body can have the maximal manoeuvrability as compared to other symmetry types. This confers an obvious selective advantage on the bilateral animal. Implications of the hypothesis: These considerations imply the view that animal evolution is a highly channelled process, in which bilateral and radial body symmetries seem to be inevitable.},

Based on general principles of the genetic regulation of morphogenesis, it can be seen that the difference between the symmetry of the whole body and that of minor anatomical structures is only a question of a diverse timing during development. I propose that the animal genome, as such, is capable of expressing both radial and bilateral symmetries, and deploys them according to the functional requirements which must be satisfied by both the anatomical structure and body as a whole. Although it may seem paradoxical, this flexible view of symmetry, together with the idea that symmetry is strongly determined by function, bolsters the concept that the presence of the two main symmetries in the animal world is not due to chance: they are necessary biological patterns emerging in evolution.},

	abstract = {Symmetry is an eye-catching feature of animal body plans, yet its causes are not well enough understood. The evolution of animal form is mainly due to changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Based on theoretical considerations regarding fundamental GRN properties, it has recently been proposed that the animal genome, on large time scales, should be regarded as a system which can construct both the main symmetries – radial and bilateral – simultaneously; and that the expression of any of these depends on functional constraints. Current theories explain biological symmetry as a pattern mostly determined by phylogenetic constraints, and more by chance than by necessity. In contrast to this conception, I suggest that physical effects, which in many cases act as proximate, direct, tissue-shaping factors during ontogenesis, are also the ultimate causes – i.e. the indirect factors which provide a selective advantage – of animal symmetry, from organs to body plan level patterns. In this respect, animal symmetry is a necessary product of evolution. This proposition offers a parsimonious view of symmetry as a basic feature of the animal body plan, suggesting that molecules and physical forces act in a beautiful harmony to create symmetrical structures, but that the concert itself is directed by the latter.

Also suggests that there is no reason to consider and otherwise cilindrical animal (such as an earthworm) as bilateral just by virtue of having a few chateae and bilaterality in the internal organs.I think that here there is an underalying issue.

	abstract = {Leuconoid sponges are filter-feeders with a complex system of branching inhalant and exhalant canals leading to and from the close-packed choanocyte chambers. Each of these choanocyte chambers holds many choanocytes that act as pumping units delivering the relatively high pressure rise needed to overcome the system pressure losses in canals and constrictions. Here, we test the hypothesis that, in order to deliver the high pressures observed, each choanocyte operates as a leaky, positive displacement-type pump owing to the interaction between its beating flagellar vane and the collar, open at the base for inflow but sealed above. The leaking backflow is caused by small gaps between the vaned flagellum and the collar. The choanocyte pumps act in parallel, each delivering the same high pressure, because low-pressure and high-pressure zones in the choanocyte chamber are separated by a seal (secondary reticulum). A simple analytical model is derived for the pump characteristic, and by imposing an estimated system characteristic we obtain the back-pressure characteristic that shows good agreement with available experimental data. Computational fluid dynamics is used to verify a simple model for the dependence of leak flow through gaps in a conceptual collar–vane–flagellum system and then applied to models of a choanocyte tailored to the parameters of the freshwater demosponge Spongilla lacustris to study its flows in detail. It is found that both the impermeable glycocalyx mesh covering the upper part of the collar and the secondary reticulum are indispensable features for the choanocyte pump to deliver the observed high pressures. Finally, the mechanical pump power expended by the beating flagellum is compared with the useful (reversible) pumping power received by the water flow to arrive at a typical mechanical pump efficiency of about 70\%.},

	abstract = {Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism’s transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences. Measuring the expression of an organism’s genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism’s biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.},

Our phylogenetic analyses produced a well-supported hypothesis that confirms the monophyly of Polycladida, as well as Acotylea and Cotylea. Within Acotylea, there are two lineages not highly supported: on one hand, Leptoplanoidea (excluding Hoploplana elisabelloi) and one Stylochoidea member (Pseudostylochus intermedius) (classification sensu Faubel, 1983, 1984), and on the other hand, Stylochoidea members together with Discocelis tigrina and H. elisabelloi. The genera Stylochus and Imogine are not monophyletic. Within Cotylea, Pseudocerotidae and Euryleptidae are monophyletic, though not highly supported, while Prosthiostomidae is not. Euryleptoidea is paraphyletic. The genera Pseudobiceros and Pseudoceros are monophyletic and highly supported. Our results suggest that, within Acotylea, the prostatoid organs of Discocelis may have been derived from a prostatic vesicle. The genus Hoploplana could be included in Stylochoidea.

However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAVAILABILITY: The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/{\textasciitilde}alse/idba\_ud},

	abstract = {With the rise of EvoDevo, the topic of evolutionary novelty has received renewed attention. Indeed, it has been argued that one of the major contributions of EvoDevo to evolutionary theory is the explanation of phenotypic novelty. Despite such assertions, dispute continues over what exactly a novelty is and whether the term applies to a unique type of evolutionary phenomenon or whether it merely has informal meaning. In a recent special issue of J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) dedicated to novelty, a new definition was introduced, linking novelty exclusively with adaptation and developmental constraint. In our commentary, we discuss how defining novelty in this process oriented manner leads to heightened difficulties with the application of the term and the identification of novelties. At the same time it conceals important implications for evolutionary studies. In contrast, we argue for a character based definition that is independent from adaptive necessities and promotes the integration of evolutionary factors not included in the standard theory. The implications of approaching novelty in this manner take the issue beyond definitional debates. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 320B: 345-350, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Tropical estuaries are under increasing pressure worldwide from human impacts, but are poorly studied compared with temperate systems. This study examined a tropical macrotidal estuary, Darwin Harbour, in northern Australia, using a combination of direct measurements and literature values to determine the main sources of primary production and the sources of nutrients supporting growth. The main source of primary production was calculated to be the extensive area of fringing mangroves and resulted in a net autotrophic system (PG:R = 2.1). Much of the carbon in the mangrove forests appears to be retained within the forests or respired, as the water column was also net autotrophic despite the carbon inputs. Phytoplankton were the second largest primary producer on a whole-of-harbour basis, with low biomass constrained by light and nutrient availability. The phytoplankton were likely to be nitrogen (N) limited, based on low N:phosphorus (P) ratios, low dissolved bioavailable N concentrations (ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), urea), and evidence that phytoplankton growth in bioassays was stimulated by NH4+addition. The largest new source of N to the system was from the ocean due to higher N concentrations in the incoming tides than the outgoing tides. Atmospheric inputs via N fixation on the intertidal mudflats and subtidal sediments were substantially lower. The rivers feeding into the harbour and sewage were minor N inputs. Nitrogen demand by primary producers was high relative to available N inputs, suggesting that N recycling within the water column and mangrove forests must be important processes. Darwin Harbour is adjacent to the rapidly growing urban area of Darwin city, but overall there is no evidence of anthropogenic nutrient inputs having substantial effects on primary production in Darwin Harbour.

	abstract = {Epithelial transport related to osmoregulation has so far not been extensively investigated in annelids. Compared with the large body of information about ion transport across crustacean or insect epithelia, only a few studies have been done with isolated preparations of annelids, using the body wall of marine polychaetes or Hirudinea. Nephridial function and general body homeostasis have received more attention, and have probably been best investigated in Hirudinea. With recent advances in the molecular physiology of epithelial transport systems in vertebrates, the cloning of various transporters and ion channels, and the considerable number of osmoregulatory peptides that have now been found and analyzed from annelids, it should now be possible, and is timely, to conduct functional studies on individual selected epithelial preparations or isolated cells from annelids. Such studies may be important for establishing useful models with somewhat less complexity than mammalian systems. For example, annelids lack aldosterone, an important osmoregulatory hormone, which is a key factor in the regulation of sodium reabsorption in vertebrates. Therefore, not only would such studies contribute to annelid physiology, but they would be important in a broader sense for understanding osmoregulation and its evolution. They should also facilitate the discovery and investigation of new specific regulatory pathways.},

We tested the assimilatory capability of the respiratory tree epithelium by exposing adults of the oral deposit-feeding aspidochirotid sea cucumber Parastichopus californicus to (1) 14C-labeled unicellular algae and (2) iron-containing macromolecules, and then following the distribution of the labels in various body regions. The abundance of the 14C (nmol 14C g wet weight−1) varied among body regions. The majority of the label was associated with the respiratory trees. The next greatest concentration was in the rete mirabile of the hemal system. The amount of 14C within samples of the anterior digestive system, posterior digestive system, and body wall muscle at each sampling time was lower than that of the respiratory trees. The presence and abundance of the 14C label in samples of the hemal system and the physical association between the respiratory tree and the rete mirabile suggest initial uptake by the respiratory tree and subsequent transfer to the hemal system. The iron label from the protein ferritin and the polysaccharide iron dextran entered cells of the respiratory tree luminal epithelium. The presence of the iron label in mesenchyme cells within the connective tissue compartment of the respiratory trees exposed to ferritin further suggests directional transfer of materials. Holothurians with respiratory trees are nutritionally bipolar; the anus serves as a second mouth.},

This has been used in several papers as proof of selective feeding by Xenoturbella on nuculid bivalves. However, their feeding biology is unknown and exogenous nucleic acids might not originate from their main nutrient source. I have examined the possible pathways of nutrient uptake. The animals neither took up cells nor dissolved dyes through the 'mouth'. Instead, they possessed extensive pinocytosis through the epidermis. Therefore, it is probable that the main source of nutrients is dissolved organic matter uptaken through the epidermis. This does not exclude that phagocytosis in the gastrodermis does occur, e.g. due to direct expose of the gastrodermis during asexual reproduction. The ubiquitously present exogenous nucleic acids in Xenoturbella probably do originate from such events and not from their main food source.},

This article provides a brief overview of more than a century's research, as it relates to significant stages in the development of experimental methods and concepts of general physiology. Emphasis is placed on changing paradigms and on the interplay between this specialized field of investigation and the mainstream of physiological thought. The present status of the field is summarized. The general consensus is challenged on the basis of previously published and new data from the author's laboratory. Particular emphasis is placed on data pointing toward an ultra-rapid turnover of amino acids in part of the epidermal space of the polychaete worm Nereis diversicolor. It is suggested that intra-epidermal L-alanine is compartmentalized metabolically or physically, and the consequences of this proposition are discussed in view of the general concepts of secondary active transport and intracellular isosmotic regulation. Future studies in this area of comparative physiology should concentrate not only on the molecular characteristics of the transporter proteins, but also on the way their function is integrated in the cellular physiology of the transporting cells.

	abstract = {The city of Darwin (Figure 1) is Australia's northernmost city (latitude 12° 27'S) and closest port to SE Asia, with a natural deep-water harbour. Aboriginal people lived in the region for at least 50,000 years prior to 1869, when the British established the city of Darwin and began a period of more intense use of the harbour and modification of the surrounding environment. Early use of the harbour by Europeans included a substantial pearl shell fishery-in 1884 alone, 50 tonnes of shell were removed from the harbour. The population of the Darwin region was modest in the first 80 years of the city's history-in 1947 it amounted to only 2,500 people. When Cyclone Tracy destroyed Darwin in 1974 the population was 47,000, and in the 2001 census it was 110,000, accounting for 55\% of the total population of the Northern Territory (NT). Current projections of regional population growth amount to a population of 228,000-309,000 by 2021 (Australian Bureau of Statistics). However, despite the population growth since the establishment of the city, only since the reconstruction after Cyclone Tracy has there been significant economic development in the catchment and along the foreshore of the harbour. The primary shoreline developments have been ports, marinas and residential living. The NT economy currently has an annual gross state product (GSP) in excess of AUS 9 billion. Mining is the largest industry, accounting for 22\% of GSP in 2001-2002 (NT Govt, 2002a), followed by tourism, defence, construction and government services. Darwin already exports more live cattle than any other Australian port, and is now expanding its role as a supply base for both offshore and onshore gas projects. In 2003-2004 export cargo comprised mainly livestock (26\%), metal products (31\%) and petroleum products (18\%)-the latter comprised 68\% of import(figure presented) cargo (http://www.nt.gov.au/dpa). During this time the port had 4,400 vessel visits, and handled 1.3 million tonnes of cargo. Recent improvements in infrastructure, such as the Adelaide-Darwin rail link and an expansion of port facilities in the East Arm of Darwin Harbour, will see the expansion of the harbour as an entrepöt for trade. The NT government has ambitious plans for the expansion of the liquid natural gas industry with a vision to make Darwin Australia's fourth gas hub. The initial phase of this expansion is the construction of a pipeline from production platforms in the Timor Sea to a processing plant at Wickham Point, within Darwin Harbour. Growth in the regional economy, and particularly in the natural gas sector, will inevitably increase human impacts on the coastal ecosystems of the Darwin area. Darwin Harbour is rich in natural heritage and is relatively pristine considering that it is the backyard of a capital city. There is no other capital city in Australia that can proudly say, for example, that marine turtles nest on its beaches or that 25 of the 48 species of waterbirds found along its shoreline are listed under international migratory bird agreements. Coastal and marine habitats in Darwin Harbour are diverse and contain considerable biodiversity. The combination of a near-pristine ecological state and an ambitious prospectus for economic growth requires a pro-active approach by environmental scientists and managers. This chapter summarises the current state of knowledge of the Darwin Harbour area based upon the work of NT government agencies and on measurements of Darwin Harbour water quality and ecosystem processes made by the Australian Institute of Marine Science from 2002-2004. It attempts to capture the essence of a tropical harbour likely to undergo significant change in the next few decades but as yet apparently not greatly impacted by human activities.},

It is an enigma how the flux of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the largest resource produced on reefs, is transferred to higher trophic levels. Here we show that sponges make DOM available to fauna by rapidly expelling filter cells as detritus that is subsequently consumed by reef fauna. This “sponge loop” was confirmed in aquarium and in situ food web experiments, using 13C- and 15N-enriched DOM. The DOM-sponge-fauna pathway explains why biological hot spots such as coral reefs persist in oligotrophic seas—the reef’s paradox—and has implications for reef ecosystem functioning and conservation strategies.},

Together, these three phyla comprise the deuterostomes. Here we report the draft genome sequences of two acorn worms, Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Ptychodera flava. By comparing them with diverse bilaterian genomes, we identify shared traits that were probably inherited from the last common deuterostome ancestor, and then explore evolutionary trajectories leading from this ancestor to hemichordates, echinoderms and chordates. The hemichordate genomes exhibit extensive conserved synteny with amphioxus and other bilaterians, and deeply conserved non-coding sequences that are candidates for conserved gene-regulatory elements. Notably, hemichordates possess a deuterostome-specific genomic cluster of four ordered transcription factor genes, the expression of which is associated with the development of pharyngeal ‘gill’ slits, the foremost morphological innovation of early deuterostomes, and is probably central to their filter-feeding lifestyle. Comparative analysis reveals numerous deuterostome-specific gene novelties, including genes found in deuterostomes and marine microbes, but not other animals. The putative functions of these genes can be linked to physiological, metabolic and developmental specializations of the filter-feeding ancestor.},

Sobre el incipiente método de Syllis ramosa M'Int. '. Del Dr. Asajiro Oka en Tokio.
Introducido. 16 de agosto de 1895.
El suelo de este raro gusano de cerdas, que sirvió como material de investigación, se encontró repleto en la cueva gastral y en los numerosos canales de ejecución de una esponja de guijarros [Crateromorpha Meyeri], que se encuentra en un área marina a unos 25 km al sur de Misaki conocida por los pescadores como Hombas Se capturó una profundidad de entre 300 y 400 hilos.
Mientras examinaba la masa de gusanos en un estado fresco, noté el hecho de que muchos de los brotes estaban en pares, a ambos lados del tronco original, mientras que otros estaban solitarios en un solo lado del tronco, como fue el caso con los otros Se pueden ver dibujos. Una investigación en profundidad pronto me convenció de que estas son dos formas de desarrollar diferentes tipos de brotes. Después de comparar una gran cantidad de brotes de ambas categorías en diferentes etapas de desarrollo, ahora creo que puedo comunicar lo siguiente sobre el modo de gemación de esta forma anélida.
En Syllis ramosa la gemación tiene lugar de dos maneras diferentes. El que llamo brote intercalar es que entre dos segmentos existentes se produce uno nuevo, que pronto produce un brote en ambos lados del cuerpo. Al principio, tales cogollos pareados son casi del mismo tamaño, como los describí en la figura 1a, pero, con el desarrollo progresivo de cada uno, divergen cada vez más; Como el tamaño de una tribu pronto alcanza la dimensión definitiva de una tribu a través del crecimiento constante, lo opuesto permanece durante mucho tiempo, diría para siempre, en una cierta etapa temprana de desarrollo. Comenzando con una etapa en la que el segmento estrecho recién emergido aún no tiene un brote claramente reconocible, se puede seguir toda la serie de etapas intermedias hasta la última fase en la que uno de los brotes ya está completamente formado, indistinguible de su tronco. Observando la Fig. 1a y la Fig. 2, que representan dos etapas, una temprana y otra posterior, del desarrollo del brote, será suficiente para aclarar todo el proceso. Además, los dos brotes que se muestran en la Fig. 11, PI. XXXIII, Challenger Reports, Vol. XII están incluidos en este grupo. Cabe señalar que los segmentos encendidos en ningún momento tienen rastros de los parapodios.
El segundo tipo de gemación es el nombre de la yema de regeneración. Aquí, la primera planta del brote ocurre en el lugar donde se unió un cirro al cuerpo. Si la pérdida de un cirro afecta el brote posterior como un estímulo o, por el contrario, si el instinto de brote interno elimina el cirro existente, no puedo decir nada definitivo en este momento. En cualquier caso, la superficie fracturada, que deja un cirro demolido, funciona aquí como la zona de educación para el brote joven. Es muy interesante observar cómo con el crecimiento del brote las partes restantes del parapodio, d. h. las cerdas, etc., se encogen gradualmente, hasta que finalmente no queda rastro de ellas. En las Fig. 1b y Fig. 3 se ven dos etapas de desarrollo de yemas de esta especie; Es decir, la Fig. 3 muestra un brote en la última etapa, en el que un segmento en un lado lleva un parapodio común en el otro lado, pero una rama del mismo tamaño que el tronco. En la Fig. 1b, uno también nota el resto atrofiado, pero aún claramente reconocible del parapodio, que se encuentra al lado del brote todavía en el segmento.
A veces sucede que la cabeza se pierde con algún brote joven debido a alguna circunstancia externa. Si este es el caso, parece que cerca del punto de ruptura, crecen dos nuevos brotes, uno en cada lado; estos brotes se desarrollan al mismo tiempo, de donde pronto surge un doble brote, como el representado en la figura 4. Tal fenómeno puede no ser muy raro, ya que un gemelo similar ya proviene de M'Intosh en PI. XXX, Challenger Reports, Vol. XII. Los dos apéndices en forma de dedo que se encuentran en la parte superior de cada brote joven luego se alargan a esas girirs extra largas, armando así los extremos posteriores libres de los gusanos.
Un trabajo detallado sobre esto, así como otros no menospunto interesante en el inicio de este Annelide tengo la intención de publicar pronto.},

	abstract = {All members of the syllid genus Trypanosyllis show distinctive flattened, ribbon-like bodies and a pharynx armed with a trepan; however, the phylogenetic relationships within this genus remain unsettled, especially with respect to the genera Eurysyllis and Xenosyllis (morphologically similar). To resolve this systematic uncertainty we analysed the phylogenetic relationships of a worldwide sampling of specimens of Trypanosyllis and three related genera using multiple molecular markers. We show that Trypanosyllis as presently construed is paraphyletic, and identify a clade of striped species that were previously all considered to be Trypanosyllis zebra (Grube, 1860). We outline the case to consider Trypanosyllis krohnii Claparède, 1864 as the type species of the genus, instead of Trypanosyllis zebra. Trypanosyllis krohnii (interpreted as Trypanosyllis zebra by recent authors) was previously believed to be cosmopolitan, but we show that it includes at least seven cryptic and pseudocryptic species, five of which are described herein: Trypanosyllis kalkin sp. nov., Trypanosyllis californiensis sp. nov., Trypanosyllis luquei sp. nov., Trypanosyllis leivai sp. nov., and Trypanosyllis taboadai sp. nov. In addition, Trypanedenta gemmipara (Johnson, 1901) comb. nov. and Trypanedenta gigantea (McIntosh, 1885) comb. nov., previously included in Trypanosyllis, are here transferred to Trypanedenta Imajima \& Hartman, 1964, and Pseudosyllis brevipennis Grube, 1863 [previously named Trypanosyllis coeliaca (Claparède, 1868)] is transferred to the resurrected genus Pseudosyllis Grube, 1863. Overall our results show a complex scenario of speciation, with cases of pseudocryptic species that correspond to geographically restricted lineages.},

While some progress has been made in understanding mechanisms, relatively little is known about the evolution of regenerative ability. Which elements of regeneration are due to lineage specific evolutionary novelties or have deeply conserved roots within the Metazoa remains an open question. The renaissance in regeneration research, fuelled by the development of modern functional and comparative genomics, now enable us to gain a detailed understanding of both the mechanisms and evolutionary forces underpinning regeneration in diverse animal phyla. Here we review existing and emerging model systems, with the focus on invertebrates, for studying regeneration. We summarize findings across these taxa that tell us something about the evolution of adult stem cell types that fuel regeneration and the growing evidence that many highly regenerative animals harbor adult stem cells with a gene expression profile that overlaps with germline stem cells. We propose a framework in which regenerative ability broadly evolves through changes in the extent to which stem cells generated through embryogenesis are maintained into the adult life history.},

Their filiform shape (length 60 mu m), the elongated, helically coiled acrosome and the similarly shaped nucleus identify them as belonging to the modified sperm type often found in interstitial polychaetes. No discrete middle piece is present; the single mitochondrion, a long oval structure, is situated within the proximal urns of the nucleus. The axoneme of the long tail section contains microtubules in the conventional 9x2+2 arrangement, except that in the distal part the central microtubules are absent. A notable feature of the tail section is a cortex comprising a flat cuff, which coils around the flagellum in closely packed helicoid turns. The mature sperm are grouped in very orderly bundles of 20 or more, presumably held together by a matrix that surrounds the tail sections and is characterized by tubular structures oriented parallel to the long axis of the sperm cells. The primary spermatocytes are joined to one another by cytoplasmic bridges; a striking characteristic of these stages is the presence of two pairs of centrioles. The functional significance of this sperm morphology and their;grouping in bundles regarding the reproductive biology of this species are discussed, as is the recent debate about the direction in which sperm structure has evolved within the Bilateria.},

The more anterior gonads remain undifferentiated and probably sexually undetermined until they are needed in future stolonizations. Gonial cells, which will eventually become either male or female, are ultrastructurally identical at the onset of each stolonization period. Spermato- genesis is marked by a short proliferative period followed by differentiation and spermiogenesis. The first ultrastructural signs of spermatogenesis were found in coelomic spermatogonia on day 10 of stolon formation. Spermatogonia are joined by intercellular bridges, which are maintained until the early spermatid stage. Synaptonemal complexes mark the onset of meiosis, which is apparently synchronized in the syncytial clusters of primary spermatocytes.

The response to the periodic signal of the clock, leading to the establishment of the segmental pre-pattern, is gated by a system of travelling signalling gradients, often referred to as the wavefront.

In short-germ insects, including the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), the segment-polarity function of wg is conserved [1]. Wnt signaling is also implicated in posterior patterning and germband elongation [2-4], but despite its expression in the posterior growth zone, Wnt1/wg alone is not responsible for these functions [1-3]. Tribolium contains additional Wnt family genes that are also expressed in the growth zone [5]. After depleting Tc-WntD/8 we found a small percentage of embryos lacking abdominal segments. Additional removal of Tc-Wnt1 significantly enhanced the penetrance of this phenotype. Seeking alternative methods to deplete Wnt signal, we performed RNAi with other components of the Wnt pathway including wntless (wls), porcupine (porc), and pangolin (pan). Tc-wls RNAi caused segmentation defects similar to Tc-Wnt1 RNAi, but not Tc-WntD/8 RNAi, indicating that Tc-WntD/8 function is Tc-wls independent. Depletion of Tc-porc and Tc-pan produced embryos resembling double Tc-Wnt1,Tc-WntD/8 RNAi embryos, suggesting that Tc-porc is essential for the function of both ligands, which signal through the canonical pathway. This is the first evidence of functional redundancy between Wnt ligands in posterior patterning in short-germ insects. This Wnt function appears to be conserved in other arthropods [6] and vertebrates [7-9]. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We have identified a second zebrafish Brachyury ortholog (Bra), and show that a combined loss of Ntl and Bra recapitulates the mouse phenotype, demonstrating an ancient role for Brachyury in patterning all but the most anterior somites. Using cell transplantation, we show that the only essential role for Brachyury during somite formation is non-cell autonomous, and demonstrate that Ntl and Bra are required for and can induce expression of the canonical Wnts wnt8 and wnt3a.

To investigate the evolution of this important gene family more broadly in protostomes, we surveyed the Wnt gene diversity in the crustacean Daphnia pulex, the chelicerates Ixodes scapularis and Achaearanea tepidariorum, the myriapod Glomeris marginata and the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We also characterised Wnt gene expression in the latter three species, and further investigated expression of these genes in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Results: We found that Daphnia and Platynereis both contain twelve Wnt subfamilies demonstrating that the common ancestors of arthropods, ecdysozoans and protostomes possessed all members of all Wnt subfamilies except Wnt3. Furthermore, although there is striking loss of Wnt genes in insects, other arthropods have maintained greater Wnt gene diversity. The expression of many Wnt genes overlap in segmentally reiterated patterns and in the segment addition zone, and while these patterns can be relatively conserved among arthropods and the annelid, there have also been changes in the expression of some Wnt genes in the course of protostome evolution. Nevertheless, our results strongly support the parasegment as the primary segmental unit in arthropods, and suggest further similarities between segmental and parasegmental regulation by Wnt genes in annelids and arthropods respectively. Conclusions: Despite frequent losses of Wnt gene subfamilies in lineages such as insects, nematodes and leeches, most protostomes have probably maintained much of their ancestral repertoire of twelve Wnt genes. The maintenance of a large set of these ligands could be in part due to their combinatorial activity in various tissues rather than functional redundancy. The activity of such Wnt 'landscapes' as opposed to the function of individual ligands could explain the patterns of conservation and redeployment of these genes in important developmental processes across metazoans. This requires further analysis of the expression and function of these genes in a wider range of taxa. Background},

The polychaete Platynereis dumerilii has retained 12 of the 13 ancient wnt subfamilies and is a good model system to study the roles of the wnt ligands in spiralian development. While it has been shown that Platynereis uses a global beta-catenin-mediated binary cell fate specification module in development, the early roles of the 12 wnt genes present in Platynereis are unknown. Transcriptional profiling by RNA-Seq during early development and whole-mount in situ hybridization of embryo and larval stages were used to determine the temporal and spatial regulation of the wnt complement in Platynereis. None of the 12 wnt transcripts were maternally provided at significant levels. In pregastrula embryos, zygotic wntA, wnt4, and wnt5 transcripts exhibited distinctive patterns of differential gene expression. In contrast, in trochophore larvae, all 12 wnt ligands were expressed and each had a distinct expression pattern. While three wnt ligands were expressed in early development, none were expressed in the right place for a widespread role in beta-catenin-mediated binary specification in early Platynereis development. However, the expression patterns of the wnt ligands suggest the presence of numerous wnt signaling centers, with the most prominent being a bias for staggered posterior wnt expression in trochophore larvae. The similarity to wnt expression domains in cnidarians around the blastopore and the tail organizer in chordates supports a hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin of posterior organizing centers.},

Phylogenetic analysis of the Wnt gene family. Insights from lophotrochozoan members. Curr Biol. 12:1395.]). To obtain a more comprehensive scenario of the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family, we exhaustively mined wnt gene sequences from the whole genome assemblies of a mollusk (Lottia gigantea) and two annelids (Capitella teleta and Helobdella robusta) and examined them by phylogenetic, genetic linkage, intron-exon structure, and embryonic expression analyses. The 36 wnt genes obtained represent 11, 12, and 9 distinct wnt subfamilies in Lottia, Capitella, and Helobdella, respectively. Thus, two of the three analyzed lophotrochozoan genomes retained an almost complete ancestral complement of wnt genes emphasizing the importance and complexity of this gene family across metazoans. The genome of the leech Helobdella reflects significantly more dynamism than those of Lottia and Capitella, as judged by gene duplications and losses, branch length, and changes in genetic linkage. Finally, we performed a detailed expression analysis for all the Helobdella wnt genes during embryonic development. We find that, although the patterns show substantial overlap during early cleavage stages, each wnt gene has a unique expression pattern in the germinal plate and during tissue morphogenesis. Comparisons of the embryonic expression patterns of the duplicated wnt genes in Helobdella with their orthologs in Capitella reveal extensive regulatory diversification of the duplicated leech wnt genes.},

The trunk of such polychaetes shows numerous, nearly identical segments. Each segment bears a parapodium with species-specific morphology on either side. The posterior end of the trunk features a segment proliferation zone and a terminal pygidium with the anus and anal cirri. The removal of a substantial part of the posterior trunk is by no means lethal. Cells at the site of injury dedifferentiate and proliferate forming a blastema to regenerate both the pygidium and the proliferation zone. The pygidium forms new anal cirri, and the proliferation zone generates new segments at a rapid pace.

Cf-Piwi1 mRNA was mainly localized in the spermatogonia, spermatocytes, oogonia, oocytes of early development and intra-gonadal somatic cells. Additionally, the knockdown of Cf-Piwi1 by injection of Cf-Piwi1 -dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) into scallop adductor led to a loss of germ cells in C. farreri gonads. Apoptosis was observed mainly in spermatocytes and oocytes of early development, as well as in a small number of spermatogonia and oogonia. Our findings indicate that Cf-Piwi1 is essential for gametogenesis in the scallop C. farreri.},

The endogenous mechanism driving this reproduction rhythm exhibits the characteristics of a true circa-oscillator (circalunar clock):1.Entrainment of cyclic sexual development (and ultimately stolonial swarming) to the lunar cycle has been demonstrated both in the field and in experimental conditions. Animals in a natural population tend to reproduce synchronously during the 2nd quarter phase of the moon. In asynchronous laboratory populations, moonlight zeitgeber programs (some successive moonlit nights every 30 days) cause entrainment, provided that the zeitgeber signals exceed a critical length (between 2 and 4 days). Above this value, the length of zeitgeber stimuli does not affect the quality of entrainment. The peaks of stolon abundance are phase-set by the cessation of nocturnal illumination (mean at 20 C: 17.0 days after moonoff), independent of the length of the preceding moonlit period. The temporal pattern of increasing entrainment in the course of repetitive stimulation permits a preliminary insight into the mechanism which causes adjustment of the clock.2.Within the range of 15 to 25 C, the freerunning period is temperature-compensated (Q10=1.04). However, coupling between oscillator and overt rhythm is restricted to the (cyclic) initiation of stolonization processes. Stolon release follows at a temperature dependent interval. Changes in temperature thus result in phase-shifts of the overt rhythm of stolon release.3.The oscillator runs essentially independent of the peripheral physiological processes involved in the manifestation of the reproduction rhythm (absence of feedback influences). Temperature and starvation influence the overt rhythm while the endogenous oscillator remains largely unaffected.},

During spermiogenesis, the acrosomal vesicle undergoes conspicuous modifications leading to its final bell shape with a posterior opening. The subacrosomal material initially shows radiating filaments but in mature sperms it appears as a meshwork of electron-opaque material. The acrosomal axis is oblique with respect to the main longitudinal sperm axis. The chromatin is arranged in electronopaque strands in the early spermatids, then becomes amorphous, and is finally organized in filaments in mature sperms. Centrioles are orthogonally arranged beneath the nucleus and fibers radiate from the distal centriole to contact the plasma membrane and the single mitochondrion. The latter is located eccentrically on the side of the nucleus opposite the acrosome. A diskshaped structure is evident beneath the distal centriole. The flagellar axoneme has a 9+2 microtubule pattern. A conspicuous glycocalyx surrounds the flagellar plasma membrane, and an electron-lucent space is present between these two structures at the distal tip of the flagellum. We compare the sperm morphology of these two species of Exogone with that described in other members of the subfamily Exogoninae. The fine structure of these two species supports the occurrence of an ent-aquasperm type within Exogoninae, in accordance with the brood strategy present within this subfamily. The mode of reproduction is of taxonomic importance for defining subfamilies within Syllidae, and is likely also of phylogenetic significance. Because epitoky is probably plesiomorphic, the ent-aquasperm type found in Exogoninae can be considered a derived feature within Syllidae.},

During spermiogenesis, the acrosomal vesicle undergoes modifications leading to its final shape with a posterior opening. The nucleus appears flattened anteriorly and forms a cleft that surrounds the proximal centriole in its distal region. A 9+2 flagellar axoneme is observed. Up to five mitochondria surround the distal centriole. The spermatozoon of S. krohni can be ascribed to the ect-aquasperm type that is typical in species having external fertilisation and appears to be very similar in appearance to that of the congeneric species thus far investigated. The main difference is in the shape of the acrosome, which is more elongated and as long as the nucleus. Reproduction of syllids seems to be conservative within sub-families, and the sperm morphology can probably help in phylogenetic reconstruction. External fertilisation is a widespread strategy within the genus Syllis , probably leading to a substantial similarity in sperm morphology being maintained. It is hypothesised, however, that within the same sperm type linked to a particularly reproductive strategy, the acrosome ultra-structure can be indicative of phylogeny.},

By introducing indexes into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within current multiplex sequencing experiments. With {\textasciitilde}0.3\% these rates are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and accuracy of multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform.},

To identify a molecular marker for the Tubifex PGCs, we isolated the Tubifex homologue (Ttu-vas) of the Drosophila vasa gene. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we examined the spatial expression patterns of Ttu-vas from one-cell stage through juvenile stage. Ttu-vas messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) is present as a maternal transcript distributed broadly throughout the early stages. Ttu-vas is expressed in all of the early cleavage blastomeres, in which Ttu-vas RNA associates with mitotic spindles and pole plasms. Expression of Ttu-vas gradually becomes restricted, first to teloblasts, then to their blast cell progeny comprising the germ bands (GBs), and finally to a set of large ventral cells (termed VE cells) in a variable set of midbody segments including the genital segments (X and XI). At the end of embryogenesis, VE cells are confined to genital segments where they are presumably germline precursors in the juvenile. Staining with a cross-reacting anti-Vasa antibody suggested that VE cells express Ttu-vas protein to the same extent irrespective of their positions along the anteroposterior axis. A set of cell ablation experiments suggested that VE cells are derived from the mesodermal teloblast lineage and that the emergence of VE cells takes place independently of the presence of the ectodermal GBs that normally overlay the mesoderm. These results suggest that T. tubifex generates supernumerary presumptive PGCs during embryogenesis whose number is variable among embryos.},

	abstract = {Annelida is an ecologically and morphologically diverse phylum within the Lophotrochozoa whose members occupy a wide range of environments and show diverse life styles. The phylogeny of this group comprising more than 17,000 species remained controversial for a long time. By using next-generation sequencing and phylogenomic analyses of huge data matrices, it was finally possible to reach a well-supported and resolved annelid backbone tree. Most annelid diversity is comprised in two reciprocal monophyletic groups, Sedentaria and Errantia, which are named after the predominant life style of their members. Errantia include Aciculata (Phyllodocida{\textbackslash}thinspace+{\textbackslash}thinspaceEunicida) and Protodriliformia, which is a taxon of interstitial polychaetes. Sedentaria comprise most of the polychaete families formerly classified as Canalipalpata or Scolecida, as well as the Clitellata. Six taxa branch as a basal grade outside of this major radiation: Oweniidae, Magelonidae, Chaetopteridae, Sipuncula, Amphinomida, and Lobatocerebrum. Oweniidae and Magelonidae form a monophyletic group which we name Palaeoannelida, which constitutes the sister taxon of the remaining annelids. The early splits of annelid phylogeny date back to the Cambrian. The new annelid phylogeny highlights the variability and lability of annelid body plans, and many instances of simplifications of body plan as adaptations to new life styles can be found. Therefore, annelids will be an appropriate model to understand major transitions in the evolution of Bilateria in general. Evolutionary developmental studies are one way to investigate macroevolutionary transition in annelids. We briefly summarize the state of developmental model organisms in Annelida and also propose new candidates on the background of the phylogeny.},

It has been proposed as a new model animal for the study of regeneration, and some histological studies of this species have been carried out. On the other hand, the molecular biological mechanism of regeneration is almost unknown in this species. To clarify the molecular biological mechanism operating at an initial stage of regeneration in E. japonensis, we isolated by the cDNA subtraction method five genes whose expression levels changed in the regeneration process occurring between growing and early regenerating worms. One of the isolated genes (a novel gene named grimp) was expressed transiently from 3 to 12 h post amputation only in neoblasts and a population of mesodermal cells (the non-neoblast grimp-expressing cells) incorporating BrdU simultaneously showed mitotic activity. We succeeded in inhibiting grimp expression by RNA interference (RNAi), thus applying this technique for the first time in Oligochaeta. In knock-down worms, the number of BrdU-positive neoblasts and the non-neoblast grimp-expressing cells in the coelom drastically decreased. Moreover, the elongation and the segmentation of blastemas were inhibited, while no statistically significant inhibitory effect was observed in epidermal and intestinal cells. These results suggest that grimp is required for initial proliferation of neoblasts and some mesodermal cells for regeneration.},

At the completion of teloblastogenesis, the only cells expressing T-hb are a fraction of the micromere-derived epithelial cells. During gastrulation, nuclear T-hb is seen in spreading micromere-derived epithelial cells and also in a subset of ectodermal teloblasts. Comparisons of these results with those from other annelids suggest that hb expression in the early cleavage blastomeres and the micromere-derived epithelium are features highly conserved among annelids.

At this time, Ttu-cdx expression is detected in a few cells that are located in the anteriormost part of the mesodermal germ bands (GBs). As development proceeds and the GBs elongate, the domain of Ttu-cdx-expressing cells in the GBs extends posteriorly. During this process, M teloblasts and primary blast cells remained negative for Ttu-cdx expression. This Ttu-cdx expression pattern is in sharp contrast to the posterior caudal expression in other organisms. Expression of Ttu-dl is detected from the one-cell stage through to the gastrula stage. Although Ttu-dl is expressed in most blastomeres, there are regional differences in Ttu-dl expression levels. During early cleavage, a large amount of Ttu-dl mRNA, which is supplied maternally, is inherited by D-cell line micromeres 2d and 4d; the remaining micromeres and macromeres inherit relatively small amounts of Ttu-dl transcripts. Another regional difference in Ttu-dl expression levels is seen in the ectodermal GB that is comprised of four bast-cell bandlets. The ventralmost bandlet (N lineage) exhibits the highest level of Ttu-dl expression with the lowest level in the two middle bandlets (O and P lineages) and an intermediate level in the dorsalmost bandlet (Q lineage).},

Expression of nos-related genes is associated with the germ line in a broad variety of other taxa, including the leech Helobdella robusta, where zygotically expressed Hro-nos appears to be associated with primordial germ cells. The function of maternally inherited Hro-nos transcripts remains to be determined, however. Here, the function of maternal Hro-nos is examined using an antisense morpholino (MO) knockdown strategy, as confirmed by immunostaining and western blot analysis. HRO-NOS knockdown embryos exhibit abnormalities in the distribution of micromeres during cleavage. Subsequently, their germinal bands are positioned abnormally with respect to the embryonic midline and the micromere cap, epiboly fails, and the HRO-NOS knockdown embryos die. This lethality can be rescued by injection of mRNA encoding an eGFP::HRO-NOS fusion protein. HRO-NOS knockdown embryos make their normal complements of mesodermal and ectodermal teloblasts, and the progeny of these teloblasts segregate into distinct mesodermal and ectodermal layers. These results suggest that maternal Hro-nos is required for embryonic development. However, contrary to previous suggestions, maternal inherited Hro-nos does not appear necessary for ectoderm specification. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many lophotrochozoans (i.e., molluscs, annelids, nemerteans, and polyclad flatworms) display a well-conserved early developmental program called spiral cleavage that contrasts with the high diversity of adult body forms present in this group. Due to this stereotypical development, each cell can be uniquely identified and its lineage history known following intracellular injection of lineage tracers. Cell deletion experiments performed mainly in molluscs have demonstrated that one or two cells associated with the endomesodermal lineage represent an embryonic organizer of subsequent development and are causally involved in cell fate and body patterning. Utilizing the published fate map of the spiral-cleaving annelid Capitella teleta, we used infrared laser cell deletions to dissect the role of individual cells on the patterning of the larval body. Thirteen uniquely identifiable individual blastomeres and two double cell combination deletions were studied to assess larval phenotypes by scoring multiple morphological structures and cell type-specific molecular markers differentially expressed along the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes. Surprisingly, our results show that in C. teleta, the cellular identity of the "organizing cell" and the timing of the organizing activity are different from that of other spiralians. In C. teleta, the ectodermal primary somatoblast, 2d, is the key cell responsible for organizing activity during early embryonic development, and is necessary for bilateral symmetry and dorso-ventral axis organization of the head as well as neural, foregut and mesoderm tissue formation. Furthermore, we show that the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway does not appear to be involved in organizing activity in C. teleta. This contrasts with data from molluscs and the molecular mechanism suggested for another polychaete, Hydroides elegans, highlighting likely molecular level variation among spiralian embryos. These results reinforce the idea that an embryonic organizing activity is present across spiralians. Our data also emphasize the developmental variation within lophotrochozoans, and may ultimately provide insight into the role of developmental processes in the evolution of diverse body forms in metazoans. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Implications of the hypothesis: This revision of the germline concept explains the extensive similarities observed among stem cells and germline cells in a wide variety of animals, and predicts the expression of germ plasm components in many others. The life history of these animals can be simply explained by changes in the extent of self-renewal, proliferation and developmental potential of the primordial stem cells. The inclusion of the primordial stem cells as a part of the germline, therefore, solves many controversies and provides a continuous germline, just as originally envisaged by August Weismann.},

Here we describe a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conserved epitope in the homeodomain of engrailed proteins of a number of different arthropods, annelids, and chordates; we use this antibody to isolate the grasshopper engrailed gene. In Drosophila embryos, the antibody reveals engrailed protein in the posterior portion of each segment during segmentation, and in a segmentally reiterated sub-set of neuronal cells during neurogenesis. Other arthropods, including grasshopper and two crustaceans, have similar patterns of engrailed expression. However, these patterns of expression are not shared by the annelids or chordates we examined. Our results provide the most comprehensive view that has been obtained of how expression patterns of a regulatory gene vary during evolution. On the basis of these patterns, we suggest that engrailed is a gene whose ancestral function was in neurogenesis and whose function was co-opted during the evolution of segmentation in the arthropods, but not in the annelids and chordates. © 1989.},

To avoid selection biases, however, comparisons ideally involve all cell types present in a multicellular organism. Here, we use image registration and a newly developed “Profiling by Signal Probability Mapping” algorithm to generate a cellular resolution 3D expression atlas for an entire animal. We investigate three-segmented young worms of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, with a rich diversity of differentiated cells present in relatively low number. Starting from whole-mount ex- pression images for close to 100 neural specification and differen- tiation genes, our atlas identifies and molecularly characterizes 605 bilateral pairs of neurons at specific locations in the ventral nerve cord. Among these pairs, we identify sets of neurons expressing similar combinations of transcription factors, located at spatially coherent anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and medial- lateral coordinates that we interpret as cell types. Comparison with motor and interneuron types in the vertebrate neural tube indicates conserved combinations, for example, of cell types cospecified by Gata1/2/3 and Tal transcription factors. These include V2b interneu- rons and the central spinal fluid-contacting Kolmer-Agduhr cells in the vertebrates, and several neuron types in the intermediate ventral ganglionic mass in the annelid. We propose that Kolmer-Agduhr cell-likemechanosensory neurons formed part of themucociliary sole in protostome-deuterostome ancestors and diversified independently into several neuron types in annelid and vertebrate descendants.},

	abstract = {We report the characterisation of a Brachyury ortholog (PvuBra) in the marine gastropod Patella vulgata. In this mollusc, the embryo displays an equal cleavage pattern until the 32-cell stage. There, an inductive event takes place that sets up the bilateral symmetry, by specifying one of the four initially equipotent vegetal macromeres as the posterior pole of all subsequent morphogenesis. This macromere, usually designated as 3D, will subsequently act as an organiser. We show that 3D expresses PvuBra as soon as its fate is determined. As reported for another mollusc (J. D. Lambert and L. M. Nagy (2001) Development 128, 45-56), we found that 3D determination and activity also involve the activation of the MAP kinase ERK, and we further show that PvuBra expression in 3D requires ERK activity. PvuBra expression then rapidly spreads to neighbouring cells that cleave in a bilateral fashion and whose progeny will constitute the posterior edge of the blastopore during gastrulation, suggesting a role for PvuBra in regulating cell movements and cleavage morphology in Patella. Until the completion of gastrulation, PvuBra expression is maintained at the posterior pole, and along the developing anterior-posterior axis. Comparing this expression pattern with what is known in other Bilateria, we advocate that Brachyury might have a conserved role in the regulation of anterior-posterior patterning among Bilateria, through the maintenance of a posterior growth zone, suggesting that a teloblastic mode of axis formation might be ancestral to the Bilateria.},

The lack of support for the monophyly of Syllidae relates to a fragment of the 18S gene, the variable region V4, which demonstrates a conflicting signal when compared to the remaining 18S sequence data.

	abstract = {Model organisms are important tools in modern biology and have been used elucidate mechanism underlying processes, such as development, heredity, neuronal signaling, and phototropism, to name but a few. In this context, the use of model organisms is predicated on uncovering evolutionarily conserved features of biological processes in the expectation that the findings will be applicable to organisms that are either inaccessible or intractable for direct experimentation. For the most part, particular species have been adapted as model organisms because they can be easily reared and manipulated in the laboratory. In contrast, a major goal in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) is to identify and elucidate the differences in developmental processes among species associated with the dramatic range of body plans among organisms, and how these differences have emerged over time in various branches of phylogeny. At first glance then, it would appear that the concept of model organisms for Evo-Devo is oxymoronic. In fact, however, laboratory-compatible, experimentally tractable species are of great use for Evo-Devo, subject to the condition that the ensemble of models investigated should reflect the range of taxonomic diversity, and for this purpose glossiphoniid leeches are useful. Four decades ago (1975), leeches of the species-rich genus Helobdella (Lophotrochozoa; Annelida; Clitellata; Hirudinida; Glossiphoniidae) were collected in Stow Lake, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA (USA). These and other Helobdella species may be taken as Evo-Devo models of leeches, clitellate annelids, and the super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Here we depict/discuss the biology/taxonomy of these Evo-Devo systems, and the challenges of identifying species within Helobdella. In addition, we document that H. austinensis has been established as a new model organism that can easily be cultivated in the laboratory. Finally, we provide an updated scheme illustrating the unique germ line/soma-differentiation during early development and speculate on the mechanisms of sympatric speciation in this group of aquatic annelids.},

	abstract = {The principle of homology is central to conceptualizing the comparative aspects of morphological evolution. The distinctions between homologous or non-homologous structures have become blurred, however, as modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has shown that novel features often result from modification of pre-existing developmental modules, rather than arising completely de novo. With this realization in mind, the term 'deep homology' was coined, in recognition of the remarkably conserved gene expression during the development of certain animal structures that would not be considered homologous by previous strict definitions. At its core, it can help to formulate an understanding of deeper layers of ontogenetic conservation for anatomical features that lack any clear phylogenetic continuity. Here, we review deep homology and related concepts in the context of a gene expression-based homology discussion. We then focus on how these conceptual frameworks have profited from the recent rise of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. These techniques have greatly expanded the range of organisms amenable to such studies. Moreover, they helped to elevate the traditional gene-by-gene comparison to a transcriptome-wide level. We will end with an outlook on the next challenges in the field and how technological advances might provide exciting new strategies to tackle these questions.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.},

This claim turns out to be quite complicated, both in terms of whether development was genuinely excluded and how to understand the different kinds of embryological research that might have contributed. The present paper reevaluates this central claim by focusing on the practice of model organism choice. Through a survey of examples utilized in the literature of the Modern synthesis, I identify a previously overlooked feature: exclusion of research on marine invertebrates. Understanding the import of this pattern requires interpreting it in terms of two epistemic values operating in biological research: theoretical generality and explanatory completeness. In tandem, these values clarify and enhance the significance of this exclusion. The absence of marine invertebrates implied both a lack of generality in the resulting theory and a lack of completeness with respect to particular evolutionary problems, such as evolvability and the origin of novelty. These problems were salient to embryological researchers aware of the variation and diversity of larval forms in marine invertebrates. In closing, I apply this analysis to model organism choice in evo-devo and discuss its relevance for an extended evolutionary synthesis.},

In a number of species, Hox genes are clustered in the genome, and the relative order of genes corresponds with position of expression in the body. Previous Hox gene studies in lophotrochozoans have reported expression for only a subset of the Hox gene complement and/or lack detailed genomic organization information, limiting interpretations of spatial and temporal colinearity in this diverse animal clade. We studied expression and genomic organization of the single Hox gene complement in the segmented polychaete annelid Capitella sp. I. Total genome searches identified 11 Hox genes in Capitella, representing 11 distinct paralog groups thought to represent the ancestral lophotrochozoan complement. At least 8 of the 11 Capitella Hox genes are genomically linked in a single cluster, have the same transcriptional orientation, and lack interspersed non-Hox genes. Studying their expression by situ hybridization, we find that the 11 Capitella Hox genes generally exhibit spatial and temporal colinearity. With the exception of CapI-Post1, Capitella Hox genes are all expressed in broad ectodermal domains during larval development, consistent with providing positional information along the anterior-posterior axis. The anterior genes CapI-lab, CapI-pb, and CapI-Hox3 initiate expression prior to the appearance of segments, while more posterior genes appear at or soon after segments appear. Many of the Capitella Hox genes have either an anterior or posterior expression boundary coinciding with the thoracic-abdomen transition, a major body tagma boundary. Following metamorphosis, several expression patterns change, including appearance of distinct posterior boundaries and restriction to the central nervous system. Capitella Hox genes have maintained a clustered organization, are expressed in the canonical anterior-posterior order found in other metazoans, and exhibit spatial and temporal colinearity, reflecting Hox gene characteristics that likely existed in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor.},

To elucidate the evolution of segmentation and, ultimately, to align segments across remote phyla, we undertook a refined expression analysis to precisely register the expression of conserved regionalization genes with morphological boundaries and segmental units in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We find that Pdu-otx defines a brain region anterior to the first discernable segmental entity that is delineated by a stripe of engrailed-expressing cells. The first segment is a "cryptic" segment that lacks chaetae and parapodia. This and the subsequent three chaetigerous larval segments harbor the anterior expression boundary of gbx, hox1, hox4, and lox5 genes, respectively. This molecular segmental topography matches the segmental pattern of otx, gbx, and Hox gene expression in arthropods. Our data thus support the view that an ancestral ground pattern of segmental identities existed in the trunk of the last common protostome ancestor that was lost or modified in protostomes lacking overt segmentation.},

Expression studies reveal a biphasic expression pattern. In early larval stages, well before any indications of segmental organization exist, a novel pattern of expression in bilateral posterior proliferating cell populations, corresponding to the teloblasts, was detected for each of the genes, with CH-Hox1 and CH-Hox2 expressed before the remaining three. In middle larval stages, all five genes are expressed in bilateral strips along the ventral midline, corresponding with the developing ventral nerve cord. In addition, CH-Hox1 and CH-Hox2 show strong expression at the foregut-midgut boundary. By late larval stages the expression is generally confined to the ventral CNS and ectoderm of the anterior parapodia. Anterior boundaries of expression are "colinear," at later larval stages, with CH-Hox2 expressed most rostrally, in the first segment, and anterior expression boundaries for CH-Hox1, CH-Hox3, CH-Hox4, and CH-Hox5 in segments 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Like vertebrates and spiders, but unlike insects, CH-Hox3 participates in this colinear axial expression pattern. CH-Hox1 and CH-Hox2 have distinct posterior boundaries of expression in the ninth segment, which corresponds to a major morphological boundary, and may reflect a reorganization of Hox gene regulation related to the evolutionary reorganization of the Chaetopterus body plan.},

H. triserialis has at least two Dfd orthologs, Lox18 and the previously described Lox6 (Kourakis et al. 1997; Wong and Macagno 1998), indicating that these genes duplicated after the last common ancestor of annelids and arthropods. Although the temporal appearance of Lox18 message is similar to that of Lox6, the spatial pattern is different. Lox18 does not have a sharply defined anterior border of expression in the second neuromere of the subesophageal ganglion of the central nervous system (CNS) as does Lox6, but is expressed uniformly in a small subset of cells in the longitudinal connectives and lateral roots in every segment of the CNS along the entire anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Even though Lox18 shares greater sequence similarity within the homeodomain and flanking regions to Drosophila Dfd than to the previously isolated Lox6, its expression pattern suggests that its function has diverged from the ancestral Hox function. Previous sampling has indicated that the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes had as many as 10 clustered Hox genes representing distinct paralogy groups (Irvine et al. 1997; de Rosa et al. 1999); leech Hox genes may have undergone subsequent and independent cluster or genome-wide duplication. These results point to the need for total genome level understanding for key members of the Lophotrochozoa.},

As a result, gene function interpretations were often based on phenotypes observed in those models and led to the definition of a set of genes, considered as specific of the germline, named the "germline core". However, some of these genes were shown to also be involved in somatic stem cells, thus leading to the notion of germline multipotency program (GMP). Because Porifera and Ctenophora are currently the best candidates to be the sister-group to all other animals, the comparative analysis of gene contents and functions between these phyla, Cnidaria and Bilateria is expected to provide clues on early animal evolution and on the links between somatic and germ lineages. Our present bioinformatic analyses at the metazoan scale show that a set of 18 GMP genes was already present in the last common ancestor of metazoans and indicate more precisely the evolution of some of them in the animal lineage. The expression patterns and levels of 11 of these genes in the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella lobularis show that they are expressed throughout their life cycle, in pluri/multipotent progenitors, during gametogenesis, embryogenesis and during wound healing.

The recently published polychaete and leech genome sequences revealed an equally dynamic range of diversity at the genomic level. The availability of more annelid genomes will allow for the identification of evolutionary genomic events that helped shape the annelid lineage and better understand the diversity within the group. We sequenced and assembled the genome of the common earthworm, Eisenia fetida. As a first pass at understanding the diversity within the group, we classified 363 earthworm homeoboxes and compared them to those of the leech Helobdella robusta and the polychaete Capitella teleta. We inferred many gene expansions occurring in the lineage connecting the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Capitella and Eisenia to the Eisenia/Helobdella MRCA. Likewise, the lineage leading from the Eisenia/Helobdella MRCA to the leech Helobdella robusta has experienced substantial gains and losses. However, the lineage leading from Eisenia/Helobdella MRCA to E. fetida is characterized by extraordinary levels of homeobox gain. The evolutionary dynamics observed in the homeoboxes of these lineages are very likely to be generalizable to all genes. These genome expansions and losses have likely contributed to the remarkable biology exhibited in this group. These results provide a new perspective from which to understand the diversity within these lineages, show the utility of sub-draft genome assemblies for understanding genomic evolution, and provide a critical resource from which the biology of these animals can be studied.},

A protocol for embryo microinjection in Platynereis has enabled several genetic tools to be developed, paving the way for functional studies. Recent Platynereis studies have provided insights into the function of several signaling pathways in development. Platynereis has also proven a useful model system for comparative evolutionary developmental studies, allowing the formation of new hypotheses on the evolution of neuroendocrine signaling, body patterning, and organ development.

Here, we show that the complement of Hox genes in critical protostome phyla reflects these phylogenetic relationships and reveals the early evolution of developmental regulatory potential in bilaterians. We have identified Hox genes that are shared by subsets of protostome phyla. These include a diverged pair of posterior (Abdominal-B-like) genes in both a brachiopod and a polychaete annelid, which supports the lophotrochozoan assemblage, and a distinct posterior Hox gene shared by a priapulid, a nematode and the arthropods, which supports the ecdysozoan clade. The ancestors of each of these two major protostome lineages had a minimum of eight to ten Hox genes. The major period of Hox gene expansion and diversification thus occurred before the radiation of each of the three great bilaterian clades.},

	abstract = {A common form of evolutionary variation between vertebrate taxa is the different numbers of segments that contribute to various regions of the anterior-posterior axis; cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, etc. The term 'transposition' is used to describe this phenomenon. Genetic experiments with homeotic genes in mice have demonstrated that Hox genes are in part responsible for the specification of segmental identity along the anterior-posterior axis, and it has been proposed that an axial Hox code determines the morphology of individual vertebrae (Kessel, M. and Gruss, P. (1990) Science 249, 347-379). This paper presents a comparative study of the developmental patterns of homeobox gene expression and developmental morphology between animals that have homologous regulatory genes but different morphologies. The axial expression boundaries of 23 Hox genes were examined in the paraxial mesoderm of chick, and 16 in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization and immunolocalization techniques. Hox gene anterior expression boundaries were found to be transposed in concert with morphological boundaries. This data contributes a mechanistic level to the assumed homology of these regions in vertebrates. The recognition of mechanistic homology supports the historical homology of basic patterning mechanisms between all organisms that share these genes.},

These last 10 years represent a pivotal and extremely stimulating period in the study of animal development. New techniques and approaches have rapidly evolved and enhanced our ability to search for and identify components that establish the basic body plan at the molecular, cellular, and genetic levels. Large numbers of genes involved in regulating embryogenesis and development have been characterized in many different species. As opposed to working in isolation in independent experiment systems, there has also been a general reemergence and appreciation of the value of comparative biology and evolution in the analysis of developmental problems. It is now almost routinely expected that a regulatory gene or signaling molecule witha a particular role in one vertebrate species will have a similar conserved role in other vertebrates.

Therefore, the study of other insects is invaluable for piecing together how the ancestor of all insects established its segmented body plan, and how this process can be plastic during evolution. In this review, we discuss the evolution of Antero-Posterior (A-P) patterning mechanisms in insects. We first describe two distinct modes of insect development - long and short germ development - and how these two modes of patterning are achieved. We then summarize how A-P patterning occurs in the long-germ Drosophila, where most of our knowledge comes from, and in the well-studied short-germ insect, Tribolium. Finally, using examples from other insects, we highlight differences in patterns of expression, which suggest foci of evolutionary change. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Development of the animal body plan is controlled by large gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and hence evolution of body plans must depend upon change in the architecture of developmental GRNs. However, these networks are composed of diverse components that evolve at different rates and in different ways. Because of the hierarchical organization of developmental GRNs, some kinds of change affect terminal properties of the body plan such as occur in speciation, whereas others affect major aspects of body plan morphology. A notable feature of the paleontological record of animal evolution is the establishment by the Early "Cambrian of virtually all phylum-level body plans. We identify a class of GRN component, the kernels" of the network, which, because of their developmental role and their particular internal structure, are most impervious to change. Conservation of phyletic body plans may have been due to the retention since pre-Cambrian time of GRN kernels, which underlie development of major body parts.},

	abstract = {A central challenge of developmental and evolutionary biology is to explain how anatomy is encoded in the genome. Anatomy emerges progressively during embryonic development, as a consequence of morphogenetic processes. The specialized properties of embryonic cells and tissues that drive morphogenesis, like other specialized properties of cells, arise as a consequence of differential gene expression. Recently, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have proven to be powerful conceptual and experimental tools for analyzing the genetic control and evolution of developmental processes. A major current goal is to link these transcriptional networks directly to morphogenetic processes. This review highlights three experimental models (sea urchin skeletogenesis, ascidian notochord morphogenesis, and the formation of somatic muscles in Drosophila) that are currently being used to analyze the genetic control of anatomy by integrating information of several important kinds: (1) morphogenetic mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels that are responsible for shaping a specific anatomical feature, (2) the underlying GRN circuitry deployed in the relevant cells, and (3) modifications to gene regulatory circuitry that have accompanied evolutionary changes in the anatomical feature.},

	volume = {104},
	issn = {0305-7364},
	doi = {10.1093/aob/mcn258},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nearly 30 000 species of orchids produce flowers of unprecedented diversity. However, whether specific genetic mechanisms contributed to this diversity is a neglected topic and remains speculative. We recently published a theory, the 'orchid code', maintaining that the identity of the different perianth organs is specified by the combinatorial interaction of four DEF-like MADS-box genes with other floral homeotic genes. SCOPE: Here the developmental and evolutionary implications of our theory are explored. Specifically, it is shown that all frequent floral terata, including all peloric types, can be explained by monogenic gain- or-loss-of-function mutants, changing either expression of a DEF-like or CYC-like gene. Supposed dominance or recessiveness of mutant alleles is correlated with the frequency of terata in both cultivation and nature. Our findings suggest that changes in DEF- and CYC-like genes not only underlie terata but also the natural diversity of orchid species. We argue, however, that true changes in organ identity are rare events in the evolution of orchid flowers, even though we review some likely cases. CONCLUSIONS: The four DEF paralogues shaped floral diversity in orchids in a dramatic way by modularizing the floral perianth based on a complex series of sub- and neo-functionalization events. These genes may have eliminated constraints, so that different kinds of perianth organs could then evolve individually and thus often in dramatically different ways in response to selection by pollinators or by genetic drift. We therefore argue that floral diversity in orchids may be the result of an unprecedented developmental genetic predisposition that originated early in orchid evolution.},

	abstract = {This article introduces a special issue on evolutionary innovation and morphological novelty, two interrelated themes that have received a remarkable increase of attention over the past few years. We begin with a discussion of the question of whether innovation and novelty represent distinct evolutionary problems that require a distinct conceptualization. We argue that the mechanisms of innovation and their phenotypic results--novelty--can only be properly addressed if they are distinguished from the standard evolutionary themes of variation and adaptation, and we present arguments for making such a distinction. We propose that origination, the first formation of biological structures, is another distinct problem of morphological evolution, and that together with innovation and novelty it constitutes a conceptual complex we call the innovation triad. We define a problem agenda of the triad, which separates the analysis of the initiating conditions from the mechanistic realization of innovation, and we discuss the theoretical problems that arise from treating innovation as distinct from variation. Further, we categorize the empirical approaches that address themes of the innovation triad in recognizing four major strands of research: the morphology and systematics program, the gene regulation program, the epigenetic program, and the theoretical biology program. We provide examples of each program, giving priority to contributions in the present issue. In conclusion, we observe that the innovation triad is one of the defining topics of EvoDevo research and may represent its most pertinent contribution to evolutionary theory. We point out that an inclusion of developmental systems properties into evolutionary theory represents a shift of explanatory emphasis from the external factors of natural selection to the internal dynamics of developmental systems, complementing adaptation with emergence, and contingency with inherency.},

Here, we report the expression of five Hox genes during embryogenesis of the rotifer Brachionus manjavacas and show how these genes define different functional components of the nervous system and not the usual bilaterian staggered expression along the anteroposterior axis. Sequence analysis revealed that the lox5-parapeptide, a key signature in lophotrochozoan and platyhelminthean Hox6/lox5 genes, is absent and replaced by different signatures in Rotifera and Chaetognatha, and that the MedPost gene, until now unique to Chaetognatha, is also present in rotifers. Collectively, our results support an inclusion of chaetognaths in gnathiferans and Gnathifera as sister group to the remaining spiralians.},

	abstract = {Bilaterian animal body plan origins are not solely about adult forms. Most animals have larvae with body plans, ontogenies and ecologies distinct from adults. There are two primary hypotheses for larval origins. The first hypothesis suggests that the first animals were small pelagic forms similar to modern larvae, with adult bilaterian body plans evolved subsequently. The second hypothesis suggests that adult bilaterian body plans evolved first and that larval body plans arose by interpolation of features into direct-developing ontogenies. The two hypotheses have different consequences for understanding parsimony in evolution of larvae and of developmental genetic mechanisms. If primitive metazoans were like modern larvae and distinct adult forms evolved independently, there should be little commonality of patterning genes among adult body plans. However, sharing of patterning genes is observed. If larvae arose by co-option of adult bilaterian-expressed genes into independently evolved larval forms, larvae may show morphological convergence, but with distinct patterning genes, and this is observed. Thus, comparative studies of gene expression support independent origins of larval features. Precambrian and Cambrian embryonic fossils are also consistent with direct development of the adult as being primitive, with planktonic larvae arising during the Cambrian. Larvae have continued to co-opt genes and evolve new features, allowing study of developmental evolution.},

(ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

The early development shows some variation within both phyla, and the cephalopods have a highly modified development. Nevertheless, there are conspicuous similarities between the early development of the two phyla, related to the highly conserved spiral cleavage pattern. Apical and cerebral ganglia have almost identical origin in the two phyla, and the cell-lineage of the prototroch is identical, except for minor variations between species. The cell-lineage of the metatrochs is almost unknown, but the telotroch of annelids and the "telotroch" of the gastropod Patella originate from the 2d-cell, as does the gastrotroch in the few species which have been studied. The segmented annelid body, i.e. the region behind the peristome, develops through addition of new ectoderm from a ring of 2d-cells just in front of the telotroch. This whole region is thus derived from 2d-cells. Conversely, the mollusc body is covered by descendants of cells from both the C and D quadrants and a growth zone is not apparent. This supports the notion that the molluscs are not segmented like the annelids, and that the repeated structures seen in polyplacophorans and monoplacophorans do not represent a segmentation homologous to that of the annelids.},

We find that the genome organization, gene structure and functional content of these species are more similar to those of some invertebrate deuterostome genomes (for example, amphioxus and sea urchin) than those of other protostomes that have been sequenced to date (flies, nematodes and flatworms). The conservation of these genomic features enables us to expand the inventory of genes present in the last common bilaterian ancestor, establish the tripartite diversification of bilaterians using multiple genomic characteristics and identify ancient conserved long- and short-range genetic linkages across metazoans. Superimposed on this broadly conserved pan-bilaterian background we find examples of lineage-specific genome evolution, including varying rates of rearrangement, intron gain and loss, expansions and contractions of gene families, and the evolution of clade-specific genes that produce the unique content of each genome.},

	abstract = {Despite rapid advances in the study of metazoan evolutionary history [1], phylogenomic analyses have so far neglected a number of microscopic lineages that possess a unique combination of characters and are thus informative for our understanding of morphological evolution. Chief among these lineages are the recently described animal groups Micrognathozoa and Loricifera, as well as the two interstitial "Problematica" Diurodrilus and Lobatocerebrum [2]. These genera show a certain resemblance to Annelida in their cuticle and gut [3, 4]; however, both lack primary annelid characters such as segmentation and chaetae [5]. Moreover, they show unique features such as an inverted body-wall musculature or a novel pharyngeal organ. This and their ciliated epidermis have led some to propose relationships with other microscopic spiralians, namely Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, and in the case of Diurodrilus, with Micrognathozoa [6, 7] - lineages that are grouped by some analyses into "Platyzoa," a clade whose status remains uncertain [1, 8-11]. Here, we assess the interrelationships among the meiofaunal and macrofaunal members of Spiralia using 402 orthologs mined from genome and transcriptome assemblies of 90 taxa. Lobatocerebrum and Diurodrilus are found to be deeply nested members of Annelida, and unequivocal support is found for Micrognathozoa as the sister group of Rotifera. Analyses using site-heterogeneous substitution models further recover a lophophorate clade and position Loricifera + Priapulida as sister group to the remaining Ecdysozoa. Finally, with several meiofaunal lineages branching off early in the diversification of Spiralia, the emerging concept of a microscopic, acoelomate, direct-developing ancestor of Spiralia is reviewed.},

Furthermore, an expanding collection of sequences that are directly regulated by Hox proteins provides information on the specificity of target-gene activation, which might allow the successful prediction of novel Hox-response genes. Finally, the recent discovery of microRNA genes within the Hox gene clusters indicates yet another level of control by Hox genes in development and evolution.},

We posit that the tools, concepts, and ways of thinking developed by evo-devo have profound potential to advance, integrate, and unify biological sciences as well as inform policy decisions and illuminate science education.

Functional guild classification based on taxonomic identity and morphology has linked community structure to ecological function. The functional guilds now include osmotrophic siboglinids as well as sipunculans, echiurans, and myzostomes, which molecular genetic analyses have placed within Annelida. Advances in understanding of encounter mechanisms explicitly relate motility to feeding mode. New analyses of burrowing mechanics explain the prevalence of bilateral symmetry and blur the boundary between surface and subsurface feeding. The dichotomy between microphagous deposit and suspension feeders and macrophagous carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores is further supported by divergent digestive strategies. Deposit feeding appears to be limited largely to worms longer than 1 cm, with juveniles and small worms in general restricted to ingesting highly digestible organic material and larger, rich food items, blurring the macrophage-microphage dichotomy that applies well to larger worms.

The cerebral eyes in errant polychaetes represent prototype invertebrate pigment-cup ocelli and thus resemble the presumed ancestral eyes. We have analysed expression of conserved eye specification genes in the early development of larval and adult pigment-cup eyes in Platynereis dumerilii (Polychaeta, Annelida, Lophotrochozoa). Both larval and adult eyes form in close vicinity of the optic anlagen on both sides of the developing brain ganglia. While pax6 is expressed in the larval, but not in the developing, adult eyes, expression of six1/2 from trochophora stages onwards specifically outlines the optic anlagen and thus covers both the developing larval and adult eyes. Using Platynereis rhabdomeric opsin as differentiation marker, we show that the first pair of adult eye photoreceptor cells is detected within bilateral clusters that transitorily express ath, the Platynereis atonal orthologue, thus resembling proneural sensory clusters. Our data indicate that--similar to insects, but different from the vertebrates--polychaete six1/2 expression outlines the entire visual system from early developmental stages onwards and ath-positive clusters generate the first photoreceptor cells to appear. We propose that pax6-, six1/2- and ath-positive larval eyes, as found in today's trochophora, were present already in Urbilateria.},

	abstract = {1st ed. 2015. Includes index. This multi-author, six-volume work summarizes our current knowledge on the developmental biology of all major invertebrate animal phyla. The main aspects of cleavage, embryogenesis, organogenesis and gene expression are discussed in an evolutionary framework. Each chapter presents an in-depth yet concise overview of both classical and recent literature, supplemented by numerous color illustrations and micrographs of a given animal group. The largely taxon-based chapters are supplemented by essays on topical aspects relevant to modern-day EvoDevo research such as regeneration, embryos in the fossil record, homology in the age of genomics and the role of EvoDevo in the context of reconstructing evolutionary and phylogenetic scenarios. A list of open questions at the end of each chapter may serve as a source of inspiration for the next generation of EvoDevo scientists. Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Invertebrates is a must-have for any scientist, teacher or student interested in developmental and evolutionary biology as well as in general invertebrate zoology. This volume covers the animals that have a ciliated larva in their lifecycle (often grouped together as the Lophotrochozoa), as well as the Gnathifera and the Gastrotricha. The interrelationships of these taxa are poorly resolved and a broadly accepted, clade-defining autapomorphy has yet to be defined. Spiral cleavage is sometimes assumed to be the ancestral mode of cleavage of this grouping and therefore the clade is referred to as Spiralia by some authors, although others prefer to extend the term Lophotrochozoa to this entire assemblage. Aside from the taxon-based chapters, this volume includes a chapter that highlights similarities and differences in the processes that underlie regeneration and ontogeny, using the Platyhelminthes as a case study. Gnathifera -- Gastrotricha -- Platyhelminthes -- Regeneration and growth as modes of adult development: The Platyhelminthes as a case study -- Cycliophora -- Entoprocta -- Mollusca -- Nemertea -- Annelida -- Phoronida.-Ectoprocta -- Brachiopoda.},

To investigate whether the segmented body plan of these two phyla share a common molecular ground pattern, we report the developmental expression of orthologues of the arthropod segment polarity genes engrailed (en), hedgehog (hh), and wingless (wg/Wnt1) in larval and juvenile stages of the polychaete annelid Capitella sp. I and en in a second polychaete, Hydroides elegans. Temporally, neither Wnt1 nor hh are detected in the segmented region of the larval body until after morphological segmentation is apparent. Expression of CapI-Wnt1 is limited to a ring of ectoderm marking the future anus during larval segmentation. CapI-hh is expressed in a ring of the hindgut internal to that of CapI-Wnt1, as well as in a subset of ventral nerve cord neurons, anterior gut tissue, and mesoderm. In both H. elegans and Capitella sp. I, en is expressed in a spatially and temporally dynamic manner in segmentally iterated structures as well as a population of cells that migrate internally from ectoderm to mesoderm, possibly representing a population of ecto-mesodermal precursors. Significantly, the expression patterns we report for wg, en, and hh orthologues in Capitella sp. I and for en in larval development of H. elegans are not comparable to the highly conserved ectodermal segment polarity pattern observed in arthropods at any life history stage, consistent with distinct origins of segmentation between annelids and arthropods. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In the diffusion approximation, Tsimring et al. have showed that this flow admits "fitness wave" solutions: Gaussian-shape fitness distributions moving towards higher fitness values at constant speed. Here we show more generally that evolving fitness distributions are attracted to a one-parameter family of distributions with a fixed parabolic relationship between skewness and kurtosis. Unlike fitness waves, this statistical pattern encompasses both positive and negative (a.k.a. purifying) selection and is not restricted to rapidly adapting populations. Moreover we find that the mean fitness of a population under the selection of pre-existing variation is a power-law function of time, as observed in microbiological evolution experiments but at variance with fitness wave theory. At the conceptual level, our results can be viewed as the resolution of the "dynamic insufficiency" of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. Our predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations.},

In this case, the natural category of the species is based on family resemblances (in the Wittgensteinian sense), which is why a species is not a natural kind. We describe the mechanism that generates the family resemblance. An individual recognition window and biparental reproduction almost suffice as conditions to produce species naturally. This is due to assortativity of mating which is not based on certain individual traits, but on the difference between individuals. The biosemiotic model described here explains what holds a species together. It also implies that boundaries of a species are fundamentally fuzzy, and that character displacement occurs in case of sympatry. Speciation is a special case of discretisation that is an inevitable result of any communication system in work. The biosemiotic mechanism provides the conditions and communicative restrictions for the origin and persistence of diversity in the realm of living (communicative and semiotic) systems.

	abstract = {The nanos-class gene of the leech Helobdella robusta (Hro-nos) is present as a maternal transcript whose levels decay during cleavage; HRO-NOS protein is more abundant in the D quadrant cells relative to the A, B, and C quadrants; and HRO-NOS is more abundant in the ectodermal precursor cell (DNOPQ) than in its sister mesodermal precursor (DM) (Pilon and Weisblat, 1997). Here, using in situ hybridization, we show that Hro-nos mRNA is broadly distributed throughout the zygote, is concentrated in both animal and vegetal teloplasm during stage 1 and is at higher levels in DNOPQ than in DM at stage 4b. Hro-nos expression increases after stage 7, as judged by in situ hybridization, developmental RT-PCR, and western blots; this increase must therefore represent later zygotic expression. Of particular interest, during stages 9 and 10, each of 11 mid-body segments (M8-M18) has a pair of Hro-nos positive "spots" comprising of one or two large cells each. These spots later disappear in an anteroposterior progression. We find that these Hro-nos-expressing cells are of mesodermal origin, arising in a segmentally iterated manner from the M lineage, and correspond to cells previously proposed as primordial germ cells (PGCs; Bürger, 1891; Weisblat and Shankland, 1985). These results support the proposal that nanos-class genes functioned in the specification of germline cells in the ancestral bilaterian and possibly in a separate process related to embryonic polarity in the ancestral protostome.},

	abstract = {A mechanism of evolution that ensures adaptive changes without the obligatory role of natural selection is described. According to this mechanism, the first event is a plastic adaptive change (change of phenotype), followed by stochastic genetic change which makes the transformation irreversible. This mechanism is similar to the organic selection mechanism as proposed by Baldwin, Lloyd Morgan and Osborn in the 1890s and later developed by Waddington, but considerably updated according to contemporary knowledge to demonstrate its independence from natural selection. Conversely, in the neo-Darwinian mechanism, the first event is random genetic change, followed by a new phenotype and natural selection or differential reproduction of genotypes. Due to the role of semiosis in the decisive first step of the mechanism described here (the ontogenic adaptation, or rearrangement of gene expression patterns and profile), it could be called a semiotic mechanism of evolution.

	abstract = {Studies in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms on the molecular basis of primordial germ cell (PGC) specification have revealed that metazoans can specify their germ line either early in development by maternally transmitted cytoplasmic factors (inheritance), or later in development by signaling factors from neighboring tissues (induction). Regardless of the mode of PGC specification, once animal germ cells are specified, they invariably express a number of highly conserved genes. These include vasa and piwi, which can play essential roles in any or all of PGC specification, development, or gametogenesis. Although the arthropods are the most speciose animal phylum, to date there have been no functional studies of conserved germ line genes in species of the most basally branching arthropod clade, the chelicerates (which includes spiders, scorpions, and horseshoe crabs). Here we present the first such study by using molecular and functional tools to examine germ line development and the roles of vasa and piwi orthologues in the common house spider Parasteatoda (formerly Achaearanea) tepidariorum. We use transcript and protein expression patterns of Pt-. vasa and Pt-piwi to show that primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the spider arise during late embryogenesis. Neither Pt-vasa nor Pt-piwi gene products are localized asymmetrically to any embryonic region before PGCs emerge as paired segmental clusters in opisthosomal segments 2-6 at late germ band stages. RNA interference studies reveal that both genes are required maternally for egg laying, mitotic progression in early embryos, and embryonic survival. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that vasa and piwi can play important roles in somatic development, and provide evidence for a previously hypothesized conserved role for vasa in cell cycle progression.},

Hidden in the crowd of undifferentiated cells, the PGCs have occasionally been overlooked and their formation during early embryogenesis was only revealed recently by new methodological approaches (e.g. Wu et al., 2011). Spiralians are excellent model organisms to deepen our understanding of PGC formation, given the highly stereotypical cleavage that occurs during embryogenesis. In these species, detailed cell lineage studies enable the tracing of single cells up to gastrulation stages. Here, I review our knowledge of the origin of PGCs in these invertebrates. Similarities in PGC formation among spiralian phyla as well as peculiarities of the highly derived clitellates are discussed with respect to developmental mode and evolution. Furthermore, the issue of gonad regeneration in platyhelminths and the asexually reproducing oligochaete Enchytraeus japonensis is addressed. An alternative strategy of compensating for caudal regeneration is presented for the polychaete Platynereis dumerilli. Finally, the molecular bases of PGC specification and the question of germplasm are discussed.},

	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001664806390087X},
	abstract = {In the normal course of events, the oocytes of Nereis diversicolor are shed into the celom when they are about 18 μ in diameter. They grow slowly until they are about 70 μ and then enlarge rapidly to a diameter of about 150 μ, when they resume slow growth and mature at a size of 180–200 μ. They are fertile after the diameter exceeds 180 μ. After the oocytes have reached a size of 30 μ, the rapid growth phase can be precipitated by a sudden reduction in the level of juvenile hormone secreted by the supra-esophageal ganglion, effected by extirpating the brain. Even oocytes up to a size of about 140 μ that have already begun to grow rapidly can be further accelerated by brain extirpation. Such accelerated eggs never reach full size and invariably suffer from abnormal yolk deposition, in that yolk platelets are almost entirely lacking. But some of them can be fertilized when they are only 120–130 μ in diameter, although cleavage is irregular and the eggs fail to develop beyond three or four cleavages. It is concluded that a high level of juvenile hormone inhibits rapid oocyte growth, but that even after this inhibition has been lifted, continued secretion of juvenile hormone is necessary for vitellogenesis. In this respect, N. diversicolor resembles Platynereis dumerilii, although the two species may differ in matters of detail. From consideration of the course of oogenesis in a natural population of N. diversicolor, it is evident that the stage at which the rapid growth of oocytes begins varies throughout the population. The adults breed in early spring, and by late spring young worms contain oocytes. Initially they differ considerably in the size of their oocytes, but during the summer the population becomes very much more homogeneous in this respect, so that in late autumn and early winter, when rapid growth of oocytes is most marked, nearly all the worms are at the same stage of development. This suggests that worms containing small oocytes with respect to the rest of the population start rapid growth of oocytes at an earlier stage than the more advanced worms, and so catch up with them. This conclusion is consistent with the view that removal of the inhibition on maturation imposed by a high concentration of juvenile hormone is dependent upon environmental rather than purely endogenous factors.},

Pluripotent adult somatic stem cells, called neoblasts, assure this regenerative ability. Neoblasts give rise to not only all types of somatic cells, but also germline cells. During the last decade, several experimental techniques for the analysis of planarian neoblasts at the molecular level, such as in situ hybridization, RNAi and fluorescence activated cell sorting, have been established. Moreover, information about genes involved in maintenance and differentiation of neoblasts has been accumulated. One of the molecular features of neoblasts is the expression of many RNA regulators, which are involved in germline development in other animals, such as vasa and piwi family genes. In this review, we introduce physiological and molecular features of the neoblast, and discuss how germline genes regulate planarian neoblasts and what differences exist between neoblasts and germline cells.},

In sexually reproducing animals, only they can produce gametes and contribute genetically to subsequent generations. Nonetheless, germ line specifica- tion during embryogenesis is conceptually the same as the specification of any somatic cell type: germ cells must activate a specific gene regulatory network in order to differentiate and go through gametogenesis. While many genes with critical roles in the germ line have been characterized with respect to expression pattern and genetic interactions, it is the molecular interactions of the relevant gene products that are ultimately responsible for germ cell differentiation. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the molecular functions and biochemical connections between germ line gene products. We find that homologous genes often interact physically with the same conserved molecular partners across the metazoans. We also point out cases of nonhomologous genes from different species whose gene products play analogous biological roles in the germ line. We suggest a preliminary molecular definition of an ancestral ‘‘pluripotency module’’ that could have been modified during metazoan evolution to become specific to the germ line.},

Laboratory culture of larvae, juvenile and adult individuals was successful, using laboratory-bred Eirene viridula (Hydrozoa) as food instead of Dynamena pumila on which this genus feeds in its natural habitat. Schizogamous reproduction of the asexual nurses by formation of sexual stolons was studied in detail. The observed mode of stolon formation was not consistent with earlier descriptions: it could neither be termed strictly scissiparous nor gemmiparous. Not only stock setigers but also, segments added by the prepygidial proliferation zone contribute to the very 1st stolon and also to some of the subsequent stolons. Incorporation of stock setigers into stolons led to size-reduction of the nurses. Gemmiparous stolons were formed intermittently. Contrary to earlier reports, a proliferative segment which produces all stolons except for the 1st of a stolon chain was never observed. A separate proliferation zone was generated for each new gemmiparous stolon. The further differentiation of stolons was observed, setiger formulae for stolons of both sexes were established and a sex-specific pattern of development of stolonial head appendages was detected. Oocytes are produced in the terminal setigers of the nurse and are transferred to the adjacent stolon after its head has begun to develop. Testes and sperm were found exclusively in the anteriormost setigers of the stolons. Mating and egg-laying of stolons was observed and ontogenesis of 99 larvae, hatched from the egg sac of 1 single female, was studied. No larval or deutometameres were simultaneously formed, but setigers were produced one by one. No setigerous segment was ulteriorly integrated into the peristomium as in nereid larvae. Stolons were formed at the earliest 80 days after hatching by 50 individuals. The median survival value was 214 days and a maximum life span of 550 days was recorded.},

	abstract = {Stem cells are essential for animal development and adult tissue homeostasis, and the quest for an ancestral gene fingerprint of stemness is a major challenge for evolutionary developmental biology. Recent studies have indicated that a series of genes, including the transposon silencer Piwi and the translational activator Vasa, specifically involved in germline determination and maintenance in classical bilaterian models (e.g., vertebrates, fly, nematode), are more generally expressed in adult multipotent stem cells in other animals like flatworms and hydras. Since the progeny of these multipotent stem cells includes both somatic and germinal derivatives, it remains unclear whether Vasa, Piwi, and associated genes like Bruno and PL10 were ancestrally linked to stemness, or to germinal potential. We have investigated the expression of Vasa, two Piwi paralogues, Bruno and PL10 in Pleurobrachia pileus, a member of the early-diverging phylum Ctenophora, the probable sister group of cnidarians. These genes were all expressed in the male and female germlines, and with the exception of one of the Piwi paralogues, they showed similar expression patterns within somatic territories (tentacle root, comb rows, aboral sensory complex). Cytological observations and EdU DNA-labelling and long-term retention experiments revealed concentrations of stem cells closely matching these gene expression areas. These stem cell pools are spatially restricted, and each specialised in the production of particular types of somatic cells. These data unveil important aspects of cell renewal within the ctenophore body and suggest that Piwi, Vasa, Bruno, and PL10 belong to a gene network ancestrally acting in two distinct contexts: (i) the germline and (ii) stem cells, whatever the nature of their progeny. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite their relevance as manipulators of human pathogen transmission2 and arthropod reproduction3, many aspects of their evolutionary history are not well understood4. In arthropods, Wolbachia infections are typically transient on evolutionary timescales5,6 and co-divergence between hosts and Wolbachia is supposedly rare. Consequently, much of our knowledge of Wolbachia genome evolution derives from very recently diverged strains, and a timescale for Wolbachia is lacking. Here, we investigated the genomes of four Wolbachia strains that have persisted within and co-diverged with their host lineage for ∼2 million years. Although the genomes showed very little evolutionary change on a nucleotide level, we found evidence for a recent lateral transfer of a complete biotin synthesis operon that has the potential to transform Wolbachia–host relationships7. Furthermore, this evolutionary snapshot enabled us to calibrate the divergence times of the supergroup A and B Wolbachia lineages using genome-wide data sets and relaxed molecular clock models. We estimated the origin of Wolbachia supergroups A and B to be ∼200 million years ago (Ma), which is considerably older than previously appreciated. This age coincides with the diversification of many insect lineages8 that represent most of Wolbachia’s host spectrum.

We find that it is necessary to have a proper balance of connectivity and interaction intensities so as to establish the kind of mutual cooperation and competition found in nature. It suggests evolutionary punctuated equilibrium as an emergent process, thus displaying features of complex systems. To explicitly demonstrate this fact we consider an extended form of thermodynamics, defining (for the present context) relevant out-of-equilibrium ???collective??? functions. We then show how to characterize the punctuated equilibrium through entropy-like and free energy-like quantities. Finally, from a close analogy to thermodynamic systems, we propose a protocol similar to simulated annealing. It is based on controlling the species??? rate of mutation during the hectic periods, in this way enhancing the exploration of the genome space (similar to the known behavior of bacteria in stressful environments).

Note that in this article the terms“type”, “genotype”, “species”, and “genome” are synonymous.The Tangled Nature model (TNM) – originally proposed by Hall et al. (2002) and Christensen et al. (2002) – provides a description of an evolving system that is constructed via interactions at the level of a single individual: the rules are essentially those of micro-evolution, with reproduction, mutation and annihilation being applied to individuals. This gives rise to emerging macroevolutionary patterns, with properties similar to those of punctuated equilibrium observed in fossil records. The existence of different interactions between the individuals allows a rich dynamics, involving competition, mutualism and exploitation. It is thus a useful framework to understand how punctuated equilibrium, a macroevolutionary feature, can emerge from the details of micro-evolution.The results ar basically a demonstrations of the neccessary requirements of a system in order to present a punctuated equilibrium -like dynamic.

	abstract = {Molecular developmental studies of fly and mouse embryos have shown that the identity of individual body segments is controlled by a suite of homeobox-containing genes called the Hox cluster. To examine the conservation of this patterning mechanism in other segmented phyla, we here describe four Hox gene homologs isolated from glossiphoniid leeches of the genus Helobdella. Based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis, the leech genes Lox7, Lox6, Lox20, and Lox5 are deemed to be orthologs of the Drosophila genes lab, Dfd, Scr, and Antp, respectively. Sequence similarities between Lox5 and Antp outside the homeodomain and phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that the Antennapedia family of Hox genes (as defined by Bürglin, 1994) had already expanded to include at least two discrete Antp and Ubx/abdA precursors prior to the annelid/arthropod divergence. In situ hybridization reveals that the four Lox genes described in this study are all expressed at high levels within the segmented portion of the central nervous system (CNS), with variable levels of expression in the segmental mesoderm. Little or no expression was seen in peripheral ectoderm or endoderm, or in the unsegmented head region (prostomium). Each Lox gene has a distinct anterior expression boundary within one of the four rostral segments, and the anterior-posterior (AP) order of these expression boundaries is identical to that reported for the orthologous Hox gene products in fly and mouse. This finding supports the idea that the process of AP axis differentiation is conserved among the higher metazoan phyla with respect to the regional expression of individual Hox genes along that axis. One unusual feature of leech Hox genes is the observation that some genes are only expressed during later development -- beginning at the time of terminal cell differentiation -- whereas others begin expression at a much earlier stage, and their RNA ceases to be detectable shortly after the onset of expression of the 'late' Hox genes. The functional significance of this temporal disparity is unknown, but it is noteworthy that only the two 'early' Hox genes display high levels of mesodermal expression.},

I discuss the origin of the modern fitness concept, providing context for Hamilton's discovery of inclusive fitness in relation to the puzzle of altruism. While fitness conceptually originates with Darwin, the term itself stems from Spencer and crystallized quantitatively in the early twentieth century. Hamiltonian inclusive fitness, with Price's reformulation, provided the solution to Darwin's 'special difficulty'-the evolution of caste polymorphism and sterility in social insects. Hamilton further explored the roles of inclusive fitness and reciprocation to tackle Darwin's other difficulty, the evolution of human altruism. The heuristically powerful inclusive fitness concept ramified over the past 50 years: the number and diversity of 'offspring ideas' that it has engendered render it a fitter fitness concept, one that Darwin would have appreciated.},

A simple yet fundamental question is how sex affects the mean and variance in fitness. Despite its importance to the theory, this type of data is available for only a handful of taxa. Here, we report two experiments in which we measure the effect of sex on the mean and variance in fitness in the monogonont rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus. Compared to asexually derived offspring, we find that sexual offspring have lower mean fitness and less genetic variance in fitness. These results indicate that, at least in the laboratory, there are both short- and long-term disadvantages associated with sexual reproduction.

Furthermore, the species carrying different sex-autosome translocations appear monophyletic, suggesting that a genome modification allowing a higher rate of occurrence and/or fixation of such translocations took place, leading to the emergence of this lineage.

	annote = {Fisher’s classical model of natural selection is a mathematical synthesis of the basic principles of the Darwinian theory of evolution and the Mendelian genetics. The resulting Fundamental Theorem guarantees that the mean fitness of population increases in the course of the selection. The Fundamental Theorem can not be extended to selection-mutation processes just by adding a mutation term to the dynamic selection model. In fact, the mean fitness of the population will not necessarily increase. However, introducing the concept of balance of the potential fitnes due to mutation, as an extension of Fisher’s Fundamental Theorem, it can be shown that in the selection-mutation process the velocity of the evolution is proportional to the sum of the variance of the potential fitness and the balance of potential fitness. In terms of the model parameters, the discrepancy from the classical Fisher theorem is also estimated. Moreover, for an outlook it is worth to mention that a similar analysis of the effect of mutation could be carried out to the Fundamental Theorem formulated in terms of the so-called relative advantage, that similarly to the the classical case, increases in the course of a pure selection process, see Garay and Varga (1999).},

In bacteria, another important source of variation is horizontal gene transfer. This source of variation can also cause beneficial or deleterious effects. Determining the distribution of fitness effects of mutations in different environments and genetic backgrounds is an active research field. In bacteria, knowledge of these distributions is key for understanding important traits. For example, for determining the dynamics of microorganisms with a high genomic mutation rate (mutators), and for understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance, and the emergence of pathogenic traits. All of these characteristics are extremely relevant for human health both at the individual and population levels. Experimental evolution has been a valuable tool to address these questions.

In other words, high variance in reproductive success within a generation can result in a very low effective population size in an organism with large numbers of adults and consequently a very low N-e/N ratio.

Obtaining estimates of mutation rates and effects has historically been challenging, and little theory has been available for predicting the distribution of fitness effects (DFE); however, there have been recent advances on both fronts. Extreme-value theory predicts the DFE of beneficial mutations in well-adapted populations, while phenotypic fitness landscape models make predictions for the DFE of all mutations as a function of the initial level of adaptation and the strength of stabilizing selection on traits underlying fitness. Direct experimental evidence confirms predictions on the DFE of beneficial mutations and favors distributions that are roughly exponential but bounded on the right. A growing number of studies infer the DFE using genomic patterns of polymorphism and divergence, recovering a wide range of DFE. Future work should be aimed at identifying factors driving the observed variation in the DFE. We emphasize the need for further theory explicitly incorporating the effects of partial pleiotropy and heterogeneity in the environment on the expected DFE.},

Extending earlier work, recent theory makes two predictions that seem to be robust to biological details: the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations before selection should be (i) exponential and (ii) invariant, meaning it is always exponential regardless of the fitness rank of the wild-type allele. Here we test these predictions by assaying the fitness of 665 independently derived single-step mutations in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a range of environments. We show that the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations is indistinguishable from an exponential despite marked variation in the fitness rank of the wild type across environments. These results suggest that the initial step in adaptive evolution--the production of novel beneficial mutants from which selection sorts--is very general, being characterized by an approximately exponential distribution with many mutations of small effect and few of large effect. We also document substantial variation in the pleiotropic costs of antibiotic resistance, a result that may have implications for strategies aimed at eliminating resistant pathogens in animal and human populations.},

	abstract = {The mouth opening of bilaterian animals develops either separate from (deuterostomy) or connected to (protostomy) the embryonic blastopore, the site of endomesoderm internalization. Although this distinction preluded the classification of bilat- erian animals in Deuterostomia and Protostomia, and has influenced major scenarios of bilaterian evolution, the developmen- tal basis for the appearance of these different embryonic patterns remains unclear. To identify the underlying mechanisms, we compared the development of two brachiopod species that show deuterostomy (Novocrania anomala) and protostomy (Terebratalia transversa), respectively. We show that the differential activity of Wnt signalling, together with the timing and location of mesoderm formation, correlate with the differential behaviour and fate of the blastopore. We further assess these principles in the spiral-cleaving group Annelida, and propose that the developmental relationships of mouth and blastoporal openings are secondary by-products of variations in axial and mesoderm development. This challenges the previous evolution- ary emphasis on extant blastoporal behaviours to explain the origin and diversification of bilaterian animals.},

Based on allozyme and developmental studies, it is now clear that C. capitata is a species complex consisting of multiple distinct lineages worldwide, including the recently described C. teleta, a model species for spiralian development. The coast of the northern Gulf of Mexico, with its numerous bays and estuaries and frequently occurring natural and anthropogenic disturbances, provides an appropriate region for such studies. We sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene for individuals of C. cf. capitata and C. cf. aciculata (distinguished by acicular spines on the first two chaetigers) collected from Texas and Florida coasts and analyzed them in conjunction with data available in GenBank. Our results indicate the presence of a Gulf of Mexico clade that is distinct from populations in Canada and the Indo-Pacific. Populations in the northern Gulf of Mexico are structured geographically, with support for Texas and Florida clades, and there do not seem to be clear boundaries between C. cf. capitata and C. cf. aciculata. This is corroborated by the fact that multiple specimens were morphologically intermediate between the two species. In future studies, we aim to clarify whether the intermediate mor- phologies represent ontogenetic stages, neutral morphological variation, phenotypic plastic- ity, or sexual dimorphism in a single species or whether several lineages with incomplete reproductive barriers are present.},

	abstract = {The idea of genetic assimilation, that environmentally induced phenotypes may become genetically fixed and no longer require the original environmental stimulus, has had varied success through time in evolutionary biology research. Proposed by Waddington in the 1940s, it became an area of active empirical research mostly thanks to the efforts of its inventor and his collaborators. It was then attacked as of minor importance during the "hardening" of the neo-Darwinian synthesis and was relegated to a secondary role for decades. Recently, several papers have appeared, mostly independently of each other, to explore the likelihood of genetic assimilation as a biological phenomenon and its potential importance to our understanding of evolution. In this article we briefly trace the history of the concept and then discuss theoretical models that have newly employed genetic assimilation in a variety of contexts. We propose a typical scenario of evolution of genetic assimilation via an intermediate stage of phenotypic plasticity and present potential examples of the same. We also discuss a conceptual map of current and future lines of research aimed at exploring the actual relevance of genetic assimilation for evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {The so-called "species problem" has plagued evolutionary biology since before Darwin's publication of the aptly titled Origin of Species. Many biologists think the problem is just a matter of semantics; others complain that it will not be solved until we have more empirical data. Yet, we don't seem to be able to escape discussing it and teaching seminars about it. In this paper, I briefly examine the main themes of the biological and philosophical literatures on the species problem, focusing on identifying common threads as well as relevant differences. I then argue two fundamental points. First, the species problem is not primarily an empirical one, but it is rather fraught with philosophical questions that require-but cannot be settled by-empirical evidence. Second, the (dis-)solution lies in explicitly adopting Wittgenstein's idea of "family resemblance" or cluster concepts, and to consider species as an example of such concepts. This solution has several attractive features, including bringing together apparently diverging themes of discussion among biologists and philosophers. The current proposal is conceptually independent (though not incompatible) with the pluralist approach to the species problem advocated by Mishler, Donoghue, Kitcher and Dupré, which implies that distinct aspects of the species question need to be emphasized depending on the goals of the researcher. From the biological literature, the concept of species that most closely matches the philosophical discussion presented here is Templeton's cohesion idea.},

These subepidermal cells coexpress many PCGs. We propose that these subepidermal cells provide a system ofbody coordinates and positional information for regeneration, and identify them to be muscle cells of the planarian body wall. Almost all planarian muscle cells express PCGs, suggesting a dual function: contraction and control of patterning. PCG expression is dynamic in muscle cells after injury, even in the absence of neoblasts, suggesting that muscle is instructive for regeneration. We conclude that planarian regeneration involves two highly flexible systems: pluripotent neoblasts that can generate any new cell type and muscle cells that provide positional instructions for the regeneration of any body region},

To gain insights into depth regulation we studied ciliary locomotor control in the planktonic larva of the marine annelid, Platynereis. We found several neuropeptides expressed in distinct sensory neurons that innervate locomotor cilia. Neuropeptides altered ciliary beat frequency and the rate of calcium-evoked ciliary arrests. These changes influenced larval orientation, vertical swimming, and sinking, resulting in upward or downward shifts in the steady-state vertical distribution of larvae. Our findings indicate that Platynereis larvae have depth-regulating peptidergic neurons that directly translate sensory inputs into locomotor output on effector cilia. We propose that the simple circuitry found in these ciliated larvae represents an ancestral state in nervous system evolution.},

	abstract = {Regeneration abilities have been repeatedly lost in many animal phyla. However, because regeneration research has focused almost exclusively on highly regenerative taxa or on comparisons between regenerating and nonregenerating taxa that are deeply diverged, virtually nothing is known about how regeneration loss occurs. Here, we show that, following a recent evolutionary loss of regeneration, regenerative abilities can remain latent and still be elicited. Using comparative regeneration experiments and a molecular phylogeny, we show that ancestral head regeneration abilities have been lost three times among naidine annelids, a group of small aquatic worms that typically reproduce asexually by fission. In all three lineages incapable of head regeneration, worms consistently seal the wound but fail to progress to the first stage of tissue replacement. However, despite this coarse-level convergence in regeneration loss, further investigation of two of these lineages reveals marked differences in how much of the regeneration machinery has been abolished. Most notably, in a species representing one of these two lineages, but not in a representative of the other, amputation within a narrow proliferative region that forms during fission can still elicit regeneration of an essentially normal head. Thus, the presence at the wound site of elements characteristic of actively growing tissues, such as activated stem cells or growth factors, may permit blocks to regeneration to be circumvented, allowing latent regeneration abilities to be manifested.},

Character loss can frequently be found within annelids and examples of the loss of typical annelid characters, like chaetae, nuchal organs, coelomic cavities and other features, are given. A loss of segmentation is suggested for Sipuncula and Echiura; both are supported as annelid ingroups in molecular phylogenetic analyses. Moreover, character loss can be caused by some modes of heterochronic evolution (paedomorphosis) and, as shown for orbiniid and arenicolid polychaetes, paedomorphic taxa might be misplaced in phylogenies derived from morphology. Different approaches for dealing with character loss in cladistic analyses are discussed. Application of asymmetrical character state transformation costs or usage of a dynamic homology framework represents promising approaches. Identifying character loss prior to a phylogenetic analysis will help to refine morphological data matrices and improve phylogenetic analyses of annelid relationships.},

Approaching this problem requires comparing the molecular mechanisms of segmentation in diverse segmented and unsegmented taxa. Notch/Hes signaling is involved in segmentation in sequentially segmenting vertebrates and arthropods, as judged by patterns of expression of one or more genes in this network and by the disruption of segmental patterning when Notch/Hes signaling is disrupted. We have previously shown that Notch and Hes homologs are expressed in the posterior progress zone (PPZ), from which segments arise, in the leech Helobdella robusta, a sequentially segmenting lophotrochozoan (phylum Annelida). Here, we show that disrupting Notch/Hes signaling disrupts segmentation in this species as well. Thus, Notch/Hes functions in either the maintenance of the PPZ and/or the patterning processes of segmentation in representatives of all three superphyla of bilaterally symmetric animals. These results are consistent with two evolutionary scenarios. In one, segmentation was already present in the ancestor of all three superphyla. In the other, Notch/Hes signaling functioned in axial growth by terminal addition in an unsegmented bilaterian ancestor, and was subsequently exapted to function in segmentation as that process evolved independently in two or more taxa.},

During the course of evolution, different CPFs acquired distinct functions in DNA repair, light perception and circadian clock regulation. Previous phylogenetic analyses of the CPF have allowed reconstruction of the evolution and distribution of the different CPF super-classes in the tree of life. However, so far only limited information is available from the CPF orthologs in aquatic organisms that evolved in environments harboring great diversity of life forms and showing peculiar light distribution and rhythms. To gain new insights into the evolutionary and functional relationships within the CPF family, we performed a detailed study of CPF members from marine (diatoms, sea urchin and annelid) and freshwater organisms (teleost) that populate diverse habitats and exhibit different life strategies. In particular, we first extended the CPF family phylogeny by including genes from aquatic organisms representative of several branches of the tree of life. Our analysis identifies four major super-classes of CPF proteins and importantly singles out the presence of a plant-like CRY in diatoms and in metazoans. Moreover, we show a dynamic evolution of Cpf genes in eukaryotes with various events of gene duplication coupled to functional diversification and gene loss, which have shaped the complex array of Cpf genes in extant aquatic organisms. Second, we uncover clear rhythmic diurnal expression patterns and light-dependent regulation for the majority of the analyzed Cpf genes in our reference species.Our analyses reconstruct the molecular evolution of the CPF family in eukaryotes and provide a solid foundation for a systematic characterization of novel light activated proteins in aquatic environments. © 2014.},

	abstract = {Hopeful monsters are organisms with a profound mutant phenotype that have the potential to establish a new evolutionary lineage. The Synthetic Theory of evolutionary biology has rejected the evolutionary relevance of hopeful monsters, but could not fully explain the mechanism and mode of macroevolution. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that hopeful monsters played an important role during the origin of key innovations and novel body plans by saltational rather than gradual evolution. Homeotic mutants are identified as an especially promising class of hopeful monsters. Examples for animal and plant lineages that may have originated as hopeful monsters are given. Nevertheless, a brief review of the history of the concept of hopeful monsters reveals that it needs refinements and empirical tests if it is to be a useful addition to evolutionary biology. While evolutionary biology is traditionally zoocentric, hopeful monsters might be more relevant for plant than for animal evolution. Even though during recent years developmental genetics has provided detailed knowledge about how hopeful monsters can originate in the first place, we know almost nothing about their performance in natural populations and thus the ultimate difference between hopeful and hopeless. Studying the fitness of candidate hopeful monsters (suitable mutants with profound phenotype) in natural habitats thus remains a considerable challenge for the future. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Despite its ubiquitous presence in Metazoa, the function of melatonin signaling outside vertebrates is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of melatonin signaling on circadian swimming behavior in a zooplankton model, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We find that melatonin is produced in brain photoreceptors with a vertebrate-type opsin-based phototransduction cascade and a light-entrained clock. Melatonin released at night induces rhythmic burst firing of cholinergic neurons that innervate locomotor-ciliated cells. This establishes a nocturnal behavioral state by modulating the length and the frequency of ciliary arrests. Based on our findings, we propose that melatonin signaling plays a role in the circadian control of ciliary swimming to adjust the vertical position of zooplankton in response to ambient light.},

	abstract = {Since 150 years it is hypothesized now that evolution always proceeds in a countless number of very small steps (Darwin in On the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle of life, Murray, London, 1859), a view termed "gradualism". Few contemporary biologists will doubt that gradualism reflects the most frequent mode of evolution, but whether it is the only one remains controversial. It has been suggested that in some cases profound ("saltational") changes may have occurred within one or a few generations of organisms. Organisms with a profound mutant phenotype that have the potential to establish a new evolutionary lineage have been termed "hopeful monsters". Recently I have reviewed the concept of hopeful monsters in this journal mainly from a historical perspective, and provided some evidence for their past and present existence. Here I provide a brief update on data and discussions supporting the view that hopeful monsters and saltational evolution are valuable biological concepts. I suggest that far from being mutually exclusive scenarios, both gradual and saltational evolution are required to explain the complexity and diversity of life on earth. In my view, gradual changes represent the usual mode of evolution, but are unlikely to be able to explain all key innovations and changes in body plans. Saltational changes involving hopeful monsters are probably very exceptional events, but since they have the potential to establish profound novelties sometimes facilitating adaptive radiations, they are of quite some importance, even if they would occur in any evolutionary lineage less than once in a million years. From that point of view saltational changes are not more bizarre scenarios of evolutionary change than whole genome duplications, endosymbiosis or impacts of meteorites. In conclusion I argue that the complete dismissal of saltational evolution is a major historical error of evolutionary biology tracing back to Darwin that needs to be rectified.},

Most annelids, including polychaetes, have an indirect life cycle and generate their earliest segments during larval life. We have characterized the nature of the growth zone in two polychaetes, Hydroides elegans and Capitella sp. I, during both larval and juvenile stages of segment formation by examining cell division patterns with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation. Cell division patterns show commonalities between the two species, even though they have distinct body plans and life history characteristics. In both polychaetes, larval segments arise from a field of dividing cells located in lateral regions of the body, rather than from a localized posterior growth zone. Circumferential expansion of the forming segmental tissue is particularly pronounced in Capitella sp. I. Post-metamorphic segments, in contrast, originate from a classical posterior growth zone, with the exception of four posterior thoracic segments of H. elegans, which appear to arise from an area in the middle of the body, indicating plasticity of segment-generating mechanisms present in different annelid life histories. The distinct nature of larval versus juvenile growth zones in H. elegans and Capitella sp. I raises the question of the mechanistic relationship between these two growth zones. The results of this study increase our understanding of the cellular origins of segments in annelids, and serve as a basis for interpretation of molecular expression patterns associated with segment formation in polychaetes.},

Early geneticists speculated about the sudden appearance of new species via special macromutations, epitomized by Goldschmidt's infamous "hopeful monster". Although these ideas were easily dismissed by the insights of the Modern Synthesis, a lingering fascination with the possibility of sudden, dramatic change has persisted. Recent work on hybridization and gene exchange suggests an underappreciated mechanism for the sudden appearance of evolutionary novelty that is entirely consistent with the principles of modern population genetics. Genetic recombination in hybrids can produce transgressive phenotypes, "monstrous" phenotypes beyond the range of parental populations. Transgressive phenotypes can be products of epistatic interactions or additive effects of multiple recombined loci. We compare several epistatic and additive models of transgressive segregation in hybrids and find that they are special cases of a general, classic quantitative genetic model. The Dobzhansky-Muller model predicts "hopeless" monsters, sterile and inviable transgressive phenotypes. The Bateson model predicts "hopeful" monsters with fitness greater than either parental population. The complementation model predicts both. Transgressive segregation after hybridization can rapidly produce novel phenotypes by recombining multiple loci simultaneously. Admixed populations will also produce many similar recombinant phenotypes at the same time, increasing the probability that recombinant "hopeful monsters" will establish true-breeding evolutionary lineages. Recombination is not the only (or even most common) process generating evolutionary novelty, but might be the most credible mechanism for sudden appearance of new forms.},

Annelids display broad morphological diversity but many species are among the most homonomous metameric animals. The front end (prostomium) and tail piece (pygidium) of annelids are classically described as non-segmental. However, the pygidium structure and development remain poorly studied.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Using different methods of microscopy, immunolabelling and a number of molecular markers, we describe the neural and mesodermal structures of the pygidium of Platynereis dumerilii. We establish that the pygidium possesses a complicated nervous system with a nerve ring and a pair of sensory ganglia, a complex intrinsic musculature, a large terminal circular blood sinus and an unusual unpaired torus-shaped coelomic cavity. We also describe some earlier steps of pygidial development and pygidial structure of mature animals after epitokous transformation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: We describe a much more complex organization of the pygidium of P. dumerilii than previously suggested. Many of the characteristics are strikingly similar to those found in the trunk segments, opening the debate on whether the pygidium and trunk segments derive from the same ancestral metameric unit. We analyze these scenarios in the context of two classical theories on the origin of segmentation: the cyclomeric/archicoelomate concept and the colonial theory. Both theories provide possible explanations for the partial or complete homology of trunk segments and pygidium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is considered a hopeful monster because it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development - paedomorphosis - that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders. Unlike related tiger salamanders that undergo metamorphosis, axolotls retain larval morphological traits into adulthood and thus present an adult body plan that differs dramatically from the ancestral (metamorphic) form. The basis of paedomorphic development was investigated by comparing temporal patterns of gene transcription between axolotl and tiger salamander larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) that typically undergo a metamorphosis.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Transcript abundances from whole brain and pituitary were estimated via microarray analysis on four different days post hatching (42, 56, 70, 84 dph) and regression modeling was used to independently identify genes that were differentially expressed as a function of time in both species. Collectively, more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as unique to the axolotl (n = 76) and tiger salamander (n = 292) than were identified as shared (n = 108). All but two of the shared DEGs exhibited the same temporal pattern of expression and the unique genes tended to show greater changes later in the larval period when tiger salamander larvae were undergoing anatomical metamorphosis. A second, complementary analysis that directly compared the expression of 1320 genes between the species identified 409 genes that differed as a function of species or the interaction between time and species. Of these 409 DEGs, 84\% exhibited higher abundances in tiger salamander larvae at all sampling times.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Many of the unique tiger salamander transcriptional responses are probably associated with metamorphic biological processes. However, the axolotl also showed unique patterns of transcription early in development. In particular, the axolotl showed a genome-wide reduction in mRNA abundance across loci, including genes that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary activities. This suggests that an axolotls failure to undergo anatomical metamorphosis late in the larval period is indirectly associated with a mechanism(s) that acts earlier in development to broadly program transcription. The axolotl hopeful monster provides a model to identify mechanisms of early brain development that proximally and ultimately affect the expression of adult phenotypes.},

The RNAs of likely core circadian oscillator genes localize to a distinct nucleus of the worm@s forebrain. The worm@s forebrain also harbors a circalunar clock entrained by nocturnal light. This monthly clock regulates maturation and persists even when circadian clock oscillations are disrupted by the inhibition of casein kinase 1δ/ε. Both circadian and circalunar clocks converge on the regulation of transcript levels. Furthermore, the circalunar clock changes the period and power of circadian behavior, although the period length of the daily transcriptional oscillations remains unaltered.

How a similar, highly stereotypical cleavage program can give rise to such diversity of larval and adult forms has intrigued researchers for many years.

There is a specific focus on comparisons of fate maps, patterns of cleavage, mechanisms of cell fate specification, organizing activity, and differences in molecular patterning. Some of the differences in early development represent intra-clade variation within annelids, and others hint at differences between annelids and other taxa.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Siphonophores (Hydrozoa) have unparalleled colony-level complexity, precision of colony organization, and functional specialization between zooids (i.e., the units that make up colonies). Previous work has shown that, unlike other colonial animals, most growth in siphonophores is restricted to one or two well-defined growth zones that are the sites of both elongation and zooid budding. It remained unknown, however, how this unique colony growth and development is realized at the cellular level. RESULTS: To understand the colony-level growth and development of siphonophores at the cellular level, we characterize the distribution of proliferating cells and interstitial stem cells (i-cells) in the siphonophore Nanomia bijuga. Within the colony, we find evidence that i-cells are present at the tip of the horn, the structure within the growth zone that gives rise to new zooids. Co-localized gene expression of vasa-1, pl10, piwi, nanos-1, and nanos-2 suggests that i-cells persist in the youngest zooid buds and that i-cells become progressively restricted to specific regions within the zooids until they are mostly absent from the oldest zooids. The examined genes remain expressed in gametogenic regions. No evidence for i-cells is found in the stem between maturing zooids. Domains of high cell proliferation include regions where the examined genes are expressed, but also include some areas in which the examined genes were not expressed such as the stem within the growth zones. Cell proliferation in regions devoid of vasa-1, pl10, piwi, nanos-1, and nanos-2 expression indicates the presence of mitotically active epithelial cell lineages and, potentially, progenitor cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence for i-cells in a siphonophore. Our findings suggest maintenance of i-cell populations at the sites of growth zones and that these sites are the main source of i-cells. This restriction of stem cells to particular regions in the colony, in combination with localized budding and spatial patterning during pro-bud subdivision, may play a major role in facilitating the precision of siphonophore growth. Spatially restricted maintenance of i-cells in mature zooids and absence of i-cells along the stem may explain the reduced developmental plasticity in older parts of the colony.},

	abstract = {Seventy-five years ago, the geneticist Richard Goldschmidt hypothesized that single mutations affecting development could result in major phenotypic changes in a single generation to produce unique organisms within animal populations that he called "hopeful monsters". Three decades ago, Sarah P. Gibbs proposed that photosynthetic unicellular micro-organisms like euglenoids and dinoflagellates are the products of a process now called "secondary endosymbiosis" (i.e., the evolution of a chloroplast surrounded by three or four membranes resulting from the incorporation of a eukaryotic alga by a eukaryotic heterotrophic host cell). In this article, we explore the evidence for Goldschmidt's "hopeful monster" concept and expand the scope of this theory to include the macroevolutionary emergence of organisms like Euglena and Chlorarachnion from secondary endosymbiotic events. We argue that a Neo-Goldschmidtian perspective leads to the conclusion that cell chimeras such as euglenids and dinoflagellates, which are important groups of phytoplankton in freshwater and marine ecosystems, should be interpreted as "successful monsters". In addition, we argue that Charles Darwin had euglenoids (infusoria) in mind when he speculated on the "primordial intermediate form", although his Proto-Euglena-hypothesis for the origin of the last common ancestor of all forms of life is no longer acceptable.},

All these evolutionary transitions may have contributed to the fact that Capsella bursa-pastoris (shepherd's purse) has become one of the most widely distributed flowering plants on our planet. In addition, Capsella bursa-pastoris shows a phenomenon that, although rare, could be of great evolutionary importance, specifically the occurrence of a homeotic variety found in relatively stable populations in the wild. Several lines of evidence suggest that homeotic changes played a considerable role in floral evolution, but how floral homeotic varieties are established in natural populations has remained a highly controversial topic among evolutionary biologists. Due to its close relationship with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, numerous experimental tools are available for studying the genus Capsella, and further tools are currently being developed. Hence, Capsella provides great opportunities to investigate the evolution of flower development from molecular developmental genetics to field ecology and biogeography, and from morphological refinements to major structural transitions.},

For example, vestimentiferans lack a digestive tract and have less body segments and comparative neuroanatomy can provide essential insight into the vestimentiferan body plan and its evolution. In the present study, we investigated the adult nervous system in the vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia satsuma using antibodies against synapsin, serotonin, FMRMamide and acetylated α-tubulin. We also examined the expressions of neural marker genes, elav and synaptotagmin to reveal the distribution of neuronal cell bodies. Brain anatomy shows simple organization in Lamellibrachia compared to other polychaetes. This simplification is probably due to the loss of the digestive tract, passing through the body between the brain and the subesophageal ganglion. In contrast, the ventral nerve cord shows a repeated organizational structure as in the other polychaetes, despite the absence of the multiple segmentation of the trunk. These results suggest that the brain anatomy is variable depending on the function and the condition of surrounding tissues, and that the formation of the rope ladder-like nervous system of the ventral nerve cord is independent from segmentation in polychaetes.},

Nevertheless, this vision needs to be complemented by a new adequate comparative framework, in the context of a factorial notion of homology. It may even be profitable to categorize as appendages also gut diverticula, body ingrowths and 'virtual appendages' such as the eye spots on butterfly wings. Another unwarranted framework is the Cartesian co-ordinate system onto which the appendages are currently described and where it is supposed that one patterning system exists for each separate Cartesian axis. It may be justified, instead, to look for correspondences between the appendages and the main body axis of the same animal, as the latter might be the source of the growth and patterning mechanisms which gave rise to the former. This hypothesis of axis paramorphisms is contrasted with the current hypothesis of gene co-option. Recapitulationism is a common fault in current Evo-Devo perspectives concerning the origin of the appendages, in that the evolutionary origin of appendages is often expected to be the same as one of the key mechanisms involved in the ontogenetic inception of appendage formation. This unwarranted perspective is also evident in the current debate on the nature of the default arthropod appendage. Most likely, a default arthropod appendage never did exist, as the first appendages probably developed along the trunk of an animal already patterned extensively along the antero-posterior body axis.},

The spiralians encompass diverse body plans and organ systems, and within the spiralians, annelids exhibit a variety of morphologies, life histories, feeding modes and associated nervous systems, making them an ideal group for studying evolution of nervous systems. Results: We describe nervous system development in the annelid Capitella teleta (Blake JA, Grassle JP, Eckelbarger KJ. Capitella teleta, a new species designation for the opportunistic and experimental Capitella sp. I, with a review of the literature for confirmed records. Zoosymposia. 2009;2:25–53) using whole-mount in situ hybridization for a synaptotagmin 1 homolog, nuclear stains, and cross-reactive antibodies against acetylated α-tubulin, 5-HT and FMRFamide. Capitella teleta is member of the Sedentaria (Struck TH, Paul C, Hill N, Hartmann S, Hosel C, Kube M, et al. Phylogenomic analyses unravel annelid evolution. Nature. 2011;471:95–8) and has an indirectly-developing, lecithotrophic larva. The nervous system of C. teleta shares many features with other annelids, including a brain and a ladder-like ventral nerve cord with five connectives, reiterated commissures, and pairs of peripheral nerves. Development of the nervous system begins with the first neurons differentiating in the brain, and follows a temporal order from central to peripheral and from anterior to posterior. Similar to other annelids, neurons with serotonin-like-immunoreactivity (5HT-LIR) and FMRFamide-like-immunoreactivity (FMRF-LIR) are found throughout the brain and ventral nerve cord. A small number of larval-specific neurons and neurites are present, but are visible only after the central nervous system begins to form. These larval neurons are not visible after metamorphosis while the rest of the nervous system is largely unchanged in juveniles. Conclusions: Most of the nervous system that forms during larvogenesis in C. teleta persists into the juvenile stage. The first neurons differentiate in the brain, which contrasts with the early formation of peripheral, larval-specific neurons found in some spiralian taxa with planktotrophic larvae. Our study provides a clear indication that certain shared features among annelids -e.g., five connectives in the ventral nerve cord -are only visible during larval stages in particular species, emphasizing the need to include developmental data in ancestral character state reconstructions. The data provided in this paper will serve as an important comparative reference for understanding evolution of nervous systems, and as a framework for future molecular studies of development.},

	abstract = {Modules can be defined as quasi-autonomous units that are connected loosely with each other within a system. A need for the concept of modularity has emerged as we deal with evolving organisms in evolutionary developmental research, especially because it is unknown how genes are associated with anatomical patterns. One of the strategies to link genotypes with phenotypes could be to relate developmental modules with morphological ones. To do this, it is fundamental to grasp the context in which certain anatomical units and developmental processes are associated with each other specifically. By identifying morphological modularities as units recognized by some categories of general homology as established by comparative anatomy, it becomes possible to identify developmental modules whose genetic components exhibit coextensive expressions. This permits us to distinguish the evolutionary modification in which the identical morphological module simply alters its shape for adaptation, without being decoupled from the functioning gene network ('coupled modularities'), from the evolution of novelty that involves a heterotopic shift between the anatomical and developmental modules. Using this formulation, it becomes possible, within the realm of Geoffroy's homologous networks, to reduce morphological homologies to developmental mechanistic terms by dissociating certain classes of modules that are often associated with actual shapes and functions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Cells at this border synchronously remodel their chromatin, enter the cell cycle, and undergo oriented cell division, before being added to new segments. wingless is expressed at the posterior edge of the pre-existing segment, abutted by hedgehog in the first row of the new segment. Overstimulation of Wingless signaling caused excess cells to enter the cell cycle, prolonging segmentation and widening the new segment.

While gene expression studies have provided new insight into patterns of gene regulation, a lack of reverse genetic tools has so far limited the depth of functional analyses in this species. To address this need, we established customized transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) as a tool to engineer targeted modifications in Platynereis genes. By adapting a workflow of TALEN construction protocols and mutation screening approaches for use in Platynereis, we engineered frameshift mutations in three endogenous Platynereis genes. We confirmed that such mutations are heritable, demonstrating that TALENs can be used to generate homozygous knockout lines in P. dumerilii. This is the first use of TALENs for generating genetic knockout mutations in an annelid model. These tools not only open the door for detailed in vivo functional analyses, but also can facilitate further technical development, such as targeted genome editing.},

Hes superfamily members are involved in a variety of major developmental mechanisms in metazoans, notably in neurogenesis and segmentation processes, in which they often act as direct effector genes of the Notch signaling pathway.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We have investigated the molecular and functional evolution of the Hes superfamily in metazoans using the lophotrochozoan Platynereis dumerilii as model. Our phylogenetic analyses of more than 200 Metazoan Hes/Hey-related genes revealed the presence of five families, three of them (Hes, Hey and Helt) being pan-metazoan. Those families were likely composed of a unique representative in the last common metazoan ancestor. The evolution of the Hes family was shaped by many independent lineage specific tandem duplication events. The expression patterns of 13 of the 15 Hes/Hey-related genes in Platynereis indicate a broad functional diversification. Nevertheless, a majority of these genes are involved in two crucial developmental processes in annelids: neurogenesis and segmentation, resembling functions highlighted in other animal models.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Combining phylogenetic and expression data, our study suggests an unusual evolutionary history for the Hes superfamily. An ancestral multifunctional annelid Hes gene may have undergone multiples rounds of duplication-degeneration-complementation processes in the lineage leading to Platynereis, each gene copies ensuring their maintenance in the genome by subfunctionalisation. Similar but independent waves of duplications are at the origin of the multiplicity of Hes genes in other metazoan lineages.},

This explanation has been more or less helpful in elucidating convergent resemblances among organisms since the times of Darwin. Nevertheless, intensive research has brought new knowledge on the emergence of structural similarity among organisms, especially during the last two decades. We now have manifold evidence of the phenomena of evolutionary re-entries or re-evolution, which happens when a particular character present in one organic taxon also appears in another taxon which does not share an immediate ancestry. This is not the re-appearance of the same character, but rather of a similar one. Here I propose a model of threefold origin of similar phenotypic features in unrelated organisms stemming from intrinsic, extrinsic and semiosic causation. It is suggested that neither externalist nor internalist explanations per se, nor any combination thereof, are sufficient to cover all the manifold instances of character re-evolution. There is also a special group of resemblances that consists of what is originated, shaped, and retained in evolution due to meaning attributed to them by particular organic subjects. These cases cannot be fully understood without inviting a biosemiotic approach. Integrating Uexküll’s theory of meaning with the recent evolutionary develop- mental perspective could complete our understanding of phenotypic re-evolution.},

Annelids belong to the Lophotrochozoa, the so far understudied third major branch of bilaterian animals besides deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. P. dumerilii has proven highly relevant to explore ancient bilaterian conditions via comparison to the deuterostomes, because it has accumulated less evolutionary change than conventional ecdysozoan models. Previous staging was mainly referring to hours post fertilization but did not allow matching stages between studies performed at (even slightly) different temperatures. To overcome this, and to provide a first comprehensive description of P. dumerilii normal development, a temperature-independent staging system is needed. Results: Platynereis dumerilii normal development is subdivided into 16 stages, starting with the zygote and ending with the death of the mature worms after delivering their gametes. The stages described can be easily identified by conventional light microscopy or even by dissecting scope. Developmental landmarks such as the beginning of phototaxis, the visibility of the stomodeal opening and of the chaetae, the first occurrence of the ciliary bands, the formation of the parapodia, the extension of antennae and cirri, the onset of feeding and other characteristics are used to define different developmental stages. The morphology of all larval stages as well as of juveniles and adults is documented by light microscopy. We also provide an overview of important steps in the development of the nervous system and of the musculature, using fluorescent labeling techniques and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Timing of each developmental stage refers to hours post fertilization at 18 ± 0.1°C. For comparison, we determined the pace of development of larvae raised at 14°C, 16°C, 20°C, 25°C, 28°C and 30°C.

	abstract = {Nereidid polychaetes and indeed many marine invertebrates use chemical signaling via sex pheromones to coordin- ate their reproductive behaviour. Sex pheromones attract the sexual partner and ensure the coordinated release of gametes by both sexual partners. In the current paper nereidids are used as model organisms to describe the chem- ical and behavioural basis of chemical communication in marine invertebrates. Structure-activity relationships can be used to chemically classify signals according to their biological function and suitable purification strategies are described. Pheromones in nereidids include diversemolecules such as volatile lipophilic 5-methyl-3-heptanoneand 3,5-octadiene-2-one, uric acid and small glutathione derived peptides. A prominent question in chemical signaling is the species specificity of chemical cues and the scale of their distribution in the marine environment. This evolves when one considers the wide overlap in multispecies and multiphyla spawning such as in coral reefs. Behavioural and electrophysiological assays with several nereidid species, confirm the existence of heterospecific activity of body fluids from various phyla. The ‘nuptial dance’ reproductive behaviour, as well as the release of gametes, are elicited when individuals are exposed to coelomic fluid of another nereidid species and also from lugworms, starfish, and sea urchins. The function of sex pheromones in nereidid polychaetes and their role in the timing of reproduction in relation to other environmental cues is discussed. Future research will focus on biosynthesis and reception of nereidid pheromones as well as their molecular basis and possible interactions with pollutants such as endocrine disrupters and fuel oil derivatives.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to visualise the expression of individual genes in situ is an invaluable tool for developmental and evolutionary biologists; it allows for the characterisation of gene function, gene regulation and through inter-specific comparisons, the evolutionary history of unique morphological features. For well-established model organisms (e.g., flies, worms, sea urchins) this technique has been optimised to an extent where it can be automated for high-throughput analyses. While the overall concept of in situ hybridisation is simple (hybridise a single-stranded, labelled nucleic acid probe complementary to a target of interest, and then detect the label immunologically using colorimetric or fluorescent methods), there are many parameters in the technique that can significantly affect the final result. Furthermore, due to variation in the biochemical and biophysical properties of different cells and tissues, an in situ technique optimised for one species is often not suitable for another, and often varies depending on the ontogenetic stage within a species.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Using a variety of pre-hybridisation treatments we have identified a set of treatments that greatly increases both whole mount in situ hybridisation (WMISH) signal intensity and consistency while maintaining morphological integrity for early larval stages of Lymnaea stagnalis. These treatments function well for a set of genes with presumably significantly different levels of expression (beta tubulin, engrailed and COE) and for colorimetric as well as fluorescent WMISH. We also identify a tissue-specific background stain in the larval shell field of L. stagnalis and a treatment, which eliminates this signal.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: This method that we present here will be of value to investigators employing L. stagnalis as a model for a variety of research themes (e.g. evolutionary biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, ecotoxicology), and brings a valuable tool to a species in a much understudied clade of animals collectively known as the Spiralia.},

	abstract = {SYNOPSIS. The concept of modularity is fundamental to research in both evolutionary and developmental biology, though workers in each field use the idea in different ways. Although readily and intuitively recognized, modularity is difficult to define precisely. Most definitions of modularity are operational and implicit, particularly in developmental biology. Examination of several proposed definitions points to some general characteristics of developmental modules, for example their internal integration, and suggests the importance of devising a definition applicable at different levels of the biological hierarchy. Modules,like homologs, must be defined with respect to a specified level of the hierarchy, and a general definition should support both analyses of the evolving causal relationships between levels, and studies of the interconnections between modules of the same type. The designation of a developmental structure, process, or function as a "module" is a testable hypothesis; this hypothesis is confirmed in the case of the dorsal marginal zone of the amphibian gastrula, which acts as a morphogenetic module. Discussions of developmental modularity can provide a meeting place for developmental and evolutionary biologists by helping us articulate key questions at the intersection;of the two fields, and design experiments to begin answering them.},

Unlike the embryos of other model spiralians, the Platynereis embryo is transparent giving insight into the dynamic structures and processes inside the cells that accompany the prevailing anisotropic cleavages. Functional studies on cell specification and differential gene expression in embryos, larvae, and later stages are underway. Lifelong proliferation of uniform trunk segments qualifies Platy-nereis as a model for the study of gene expression and of the functional circuitry of this process. Platynereis can also become a stepping stone in the comparison of segmentation between annelids and arthropods because it comes closer to the putative ancestral morphology and style of development than other model annelids.},

Comparing nervous system development in annelids to that of other bilaterians could provide valuable information about the common ancestor of all Bilateria. We find that the Platynereis neuroectoderm is subdivided into longitudinal progenitor domains by partially overlapping expression regions of nk and pax genes. These domains match corresponding domains in the vertebrate neural tube and give rise to conserved neural cell types. As in vertebrates, neural patterning genes are sensitive to Bmp signaling. Our data indicate that this mediolateral architecture was present in the last common bilaterian ancestor and thus support a common origin of nervous system centralization in Bilateria. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Normal and regenerative growth are partially separated from maturation, since during the later stages of maturation, growth does not occur. A mature animal almost invariably regenerates a pygidium but rarely regenerates segmental rudiments. The supraesophageal ganglion of a mature animal secretes less hormone than that of an immature animal, though it still induces a significant amount of regeneration when implanted into an immature, decerebrate host. The rate of secretion of such a ganglion is as great during the first five days after implantation into the host as it is subsequently. A single ganglion from an immature donor (in which it is known to be actively secreting) induces no regeneration when implanted into a mature host. Immature grafts, from which posterior segments have been removed, engage in virtually no segment regeneration when stitched into mature hosts. However, implantation of three ganglia removed from immature donors into each graft results in the formation of a significant but very small number of segmental rudiments in host and graft. These results suggest that there may be a feedback from the maturing body, inhibiting the secretory activity of the ganglion. They are consistent with the suggestion that a single hormone secreted by the supraesophageal ganglion in immature Nereis both inhibits maturation and promotes growth in intact and regenerating animals.},

We recently established a first transgenic strain of the annelid Platynereis, using a Tc1/mariner-type Mos1 transposon vector. Here, we compare Mos1 with Tol2, a member of the hAT family of transposons. In Platynereis, Tol2-based constructs showed a higher frequency of nuclear genome insertion and sustained gene expression in the G0 generation. However, in contrast to Mos1-mediated transgenes, Tol2-mediated insertions failed to retain fluorescence in the G1 generation, suggesting a germ line-based silencing mechanism. Furthermore, we present three novel expression constructs that were generated by a simple fusion-PCR approach and allow either ubiquitous or cell-specific expression of a reporter gene. Our study indicates the versatility of Tol2 for transient transgenesis, and provides a template for transgenesis work in other emerging reference species.},

The sperm ultrastructure of Syllis gerlachi, S. prolifera and S. vittata is herein presented and compared to the Syllinae species studied previously. Moreover, the egg structure and the gamete allocation within stolons of S. vittata are particularly investigated. Both male germinal cells at different level of maturation and oocytes were found in the same individual of S. vittata, suggesting simultaneous hermaphroditism. The ultrastructural analysis revealed that the observed spermatozoa belong to the ect-aquasperm type resembling those of the similar studied species (Syllis sp., S. pigmentata and S. krohni). Differences in the acrosome structure and nucleus shape are in accordance with a recent phylogenetic reconstruction and suggest a trend in the evolution of spermatozoa in Syllinae toward the development of the apical part. However, further molecular and ultrastructural analyses are needed to support this hypothesis. This is the first record of simultaneous hermaphroditism within Syllinae.},

In evo-devo, a discipline in which the comparison of gene expression patterns is a widely used approach, such standardized anatomical atlases would allow a more rigorous assessment of the conservation of and changes in gene expression patterns during micro- and macroevolutionary time scales. Due to its small size and invariant early development, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii is particularly well suited for such studies. Recently a reference template with registered gene expression patterns has been generated for the anterior part (episphere) of the Platynereis trochophore larva and used for the detailed study of neuronal development.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Here we introduce and evaluate a method for whole-body gene expression pattern registration for Platynereis trochophore and nectochaete larvae based on whole-mount in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy, and image registration. We achieved high-resolution whole-body scanning using the mounting medium 2,2'-thiodiethanol (TDE), which allows the matching of the refractive index of the sample to that of glass and immersion oil thereby reducing spherical aberration and improving depth penetration. This approach allowed us to scan entire whole-mount larvae stained with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) in situ hybridization and counterstained fluorescently with an acetylated-tubulin antibody and the nuclear stain 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Due to the submicron isotropic voxel size whole-mount larvae could be scanned in any orientation. Based on the whole-body scans, we generated four different reference templates by the iterative registration and averaging of 40 individual image stacks using either the acetylated-tubulin or the nuclear-stain signal for each developmental stage. We then registered to these templates the expression patterns of cell-type specific genes. In order to evaluate the gene expression pattern registration, we analyzed the absolute deviation of cell-center positions. Both the acetylated-tubulin- and the nuclear-stain-based templates allowed near-cellular-resolution gene expression registration. Nuclear-stain-based templates often performed significantly better than acetylated-tubulin-based templates. We provide detailed guidelines and scripts for the use and further expansion of the Platynereis gene expression atlas.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: We established whole-body reference templates for the generation of gene expression atlases for Platynereis trochophore and nectochaete larvae. We anticipate that nuclear-staining-based image registration will be applicable for whole-body alignment of the embryonic and larval stages of other organisms in a similar size range.},

The author reviews three organisational representative responses to allegations of bulling: (1) the behaviour is acceptable; (2) the behaviour is inappropriately equally attributed to both parties as a personality conflict; and (3) the behaviour is harmful and inappropriate. The author concludes that counsellors must review potential organisa- tional representative responses with employees and recommends mandatory training for organisational representatives.},

Also the role of some individual and personality characteristics in becoming a victim of bullying were investigated. Altogether 949 municipal employees answered a mailed questionnaire; 10.1\% of them felt themselves bullied. Especially some features in the functioning of the work unit, e.g. poor information flow, an authoritative way of settling differences of opinion, lack of mutual conversations about the tasks and goals of the work unit, and insufficient possibilities to influence matters concerning oneself can all promote bullying. Both the victims and the observers of bullying perceived deficiencies in these aspects at their workplace. Gender and age did not explain bullying. The victims of bullying felt that envy, a weak superior, competition for tasks or advancement, and competition for the supervisor's favour and approval were the most common reasons for bullying.},

A total of 102 prevalence estimates of bullying from 86 independent samples (N=130,973) were accumulated and compared by means of meta-analysis. At an average, the statistically independents samples provided an estimate of 14.6\%. Yet, the findings show that methodological moderators influence the estimated rates. As for measurement method, a rate of 11.3\% was found for studies investigating self-labelled victimization from bullying based on a given definition of the concept, whereas a rate of 14.8\% was found for behavioural measure studies, and 18.1\% for self-labelling studies without a given definition. A difference of 8.7\% points was found between randomly sampled and non-randomly sampled studies. When controlling for geographical differences, the findings show that geographical factors also influence findings on bullying. Hence, findings from different studies on workplace bullying cannot be compared without taking moderator variables into account. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This study describes the gender differences found in victims of bullying and work-related stress in an Italian case series and analyzes the critical issues in the diagnostic workup.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Between 2001 and 2009 we examined 345 outpatients (148 males, 197 females; mean age: 41 ± 10.49) for suspected psychopathological work-related problems. Diagnosis of bullying was established using international criteria (ICD-10 and DSM-IV).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: After interdisciplinary diagnostic evaluation (Occupational Medicine Unit, Psychology and Psychiatry Service), the diagnosis of bullying was formulated in 35 subjects, 12 males and 23 females (2 cases of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and 33 of Adjustment Disorder). Fifty-four (20 males, 34 females) suffered from work-related anxiety, while work-unrelated Adjustment Disorder and other psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 7 and 112 subjects, respectively. Women between 34 and 45 years showed a high prevalence (65\%) of "mobbing syndrome" or other work-related stress disorders.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: At work, women are more subject to harassment (for personal aspects related to emotional and relational factors) than men. The knowledge of the phenomenon is an essential requisite to contrast bullying; prevention can be carried out only through effective information and training of workers and employers, who have the legal obligation to preserve the integrity of the mental and physical status of their employees during work.},

Data were collected from 251 white-collar employees. Path analysis findings showed that transformational and transactional leadership decreased the likelihood of mobbing, whereas authoritarian leadership increased it. Paternalistic leadership was mildly and negatively associated with mobbing. Regarding the consequences of mobbing for employees' organizational attitudes, the same analyses suggested that higher perceptions of downward mobbing was significantly associated with lower job satisfaction, lower affective commitment, higher continuous commitment, and higher turnover intention.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of childhood bullying victimisation are serious. Much previous research on risk factors for being bullied has used a cross-sectional design, impeding the possibility to draw conclusions on causality, and has not considered simultaneous effects of multiple risk factors. Paying closer attention to multiple risk factors for being bullying can provide a basis for designing intervention programmes to prevent or reduce bullying among children and adolescents. METHODS: Risk factors for bullying were examined by using questionnaire data collected in 2004 and 2007. In 2004, the participants were aged 14-15 years and 17-18 years in 2007. The baseline questionnaire was answered by 3054 individuals in 2004, and 2181 individuals participated in both rounds. We analysed risk factors for being bullied at the individual and societal level. Information on the social background of the participants was derived from a national register at Statistics Denmark. RESULTS: Several risk factors were identified. Being obese, low self-assessed position in school class, overprotective parents, low self-esteem, low sense of coherence and low socioeconomic status were risk factors for being bullied at school. Being overweight, smoking, low self-assessed position in class, low sense of coherence and low socioeconomic status were risk factors for being bullied at work. However, most associations between risk factors in 2004 and being bullied in 2007 disappeared after adjustment for being bullied in 2004. CONCLUSIONS: The strongest risk factor for being bullied was being previously bullied. Our results stress the importance of early prevention of bullying at schools. In addition, attention should be drawn to the role of overprotective parents.},

Peer acceptance is the degree to which adolescents are well liked by their peers; perceived popularity indicates visibility, dominance, and prestige. It was hypothesized that acceptance negatively predicts bullying, whereas popularity positively predicts bullying, and that both acceptance and popularity negatively predict victimization. Interactions between acceptance and popularity were tested as well. Participants were 1,207 13- to 14-year-old adolescents who completed sociometric assessments in their classrooms. Both bullying and victimization were predicted by the interaction between acceptance and perceived popularity. Bullying was positively associated with popularity, and this association was stronger for adolescents with lower levels of acceptance. Victimization was negatively associated with popularity, and this association was also stronger for adolescents with lower levels of acceptance. Linear and curvilinear main effects and interactions were found; some were further moderated by gender. The discussion focused on the role of individual status and group dynamic factors in the occurrence of aggression among early adolescents.},

Furthermore, customers and consumers are increasingly interested in healthy products and services. Therefore, health has become a (potential) business value of strategic importance. In interaction with all relevant stakeholders, an approach was developed for companies that want to manage their health impact in a proactive and preventive manner. The approach was termed Integral Health Management (IHM). IHM forms a strategic approach for reducing the costs of sickness absence and working disability, while the productivity and resilience of the company and its employees are increased. This brings the company direct economic benefits. Finally, it is of prime interest for employees to remain physically and mentally healthy and employable. The IHM approach distinguishes seven lines of development: (1) health as a strategic company interest; (2) the realization of a healthy primary process; (3) a safe and sound physical (work) environment; (4) an inspiring social (work) environment; (5) vital people; (6) a sound relationship with the immediate organizational environment and local community, and (7) healthy products and/or services. The inter-relationships between the seven development lines are essential for combining an improvement of the business impact on health with a strategic interest of companies and organizations. The seven lines of IHM development can easily be linked to the European Foundation for Quality Management's European Excellence Model.},

	abstract = {Purpose of the paper To explore what kind of measures personnel managers have taken to intervene in workplace harassment and to explore how organisational characteristics and the characteristics of the personnel manager affect the choice of response strategies. Design/methodology The study was exploratory and used a survey design. A web-based questionnaire was sent to the personnel managers of all Finnish municipalities and data on organisational responses and organisational characteristics were collected. Findings The study showed that the organisations surveyed relied heavily on reconciliatory measures for responding to workplace harassment and that punitive measures were seldom used. Findings indicated that personnel manager gender, size of municipality, use of ‘sophisticated’ human resource management practices and having provided information and training to increase awareness about harassment all influence the organisational responses chosen. Research limitations Only the effects of organisational and personnel manager characteristics on organisational responses were analysed. Future studies need to include perpetrator characteristics and harassment severity. Practical implications The study informs both practitioners and policy-makers about the measures that have been taken and that can be taken in order to stop harassment. It also questions the effectiveness of written anti-harassment policies for influencing organisational responses to harassment and draws attention to the role of gendered perceptions of harassment for choice of response strategy. Originality/value This paper fills a gap in harassment research by reporting on the use of different response strategies and by providing initial insights into factors affecting choice of responses.},

In order to understand better the logic behind bullying, a model discussing different explanations is put forward. Thus, explanations for and factors associated with bullying are classified into three groups, enabling structures or necessary antecedents (e.g. perceived power imbalances, low perceived costs, and dissatisfaction and frustration), motivating structures or incentives (e.g. internal competition, reward systems and expected benefits), and precipitating processes or triggering circumstances (e.g. downsizing and restructuring organizational changes, changes in the composition of the work group). the article concludes that bullying is often an interaction between structures and processes from all three groupings.

The aim of this study was to analyze in an exploratory way whether the organizational variables significantly predict the occurrence of mobbing. The sample consisted of 103 employees of the Community of Madrid. The results of the regression analysis showed significant results that support the organizational hypothesis in the mobbing process, being especially relevant the role that plays as much the organizational politic as the type of contract as antecedents of mobbing at work.},

Current relationship quality was assessed in terms of self-perception, attachment style and friendship quality. In total, 884 adults (35\% male) from two occupations (teacher, student) and three countries (Spain, Germany, UK) participated. Victims and especially stable victims (in both primary and secondary school) scored lower on general self-esteem and higher on emotional loneliness, and reported more difficulties in maintaining friendships, than non-victims. Victims in secondary school had a lower self-esteem in relation to the opposite sex and were more often fearfully attached. The data revealed additional differences by gender, occupation and country level, but no further interactions with victim status. This indicates a general association between victimization in school and quality of later life predominately robust to variations in gender, occupation and country. Possible limitations caused by the retrospective nature of victimization reports are acknowledged.},

Two-hundred and seventeen faculty members at a major research university in North America reported their actual and ideal responses to mistreatment. The most common responses involved passive and social support-seeking strategies. Respondents generally wished they could have been more assertive. The size of the discrepancy between actual and ideal responses to mistreatment was predicted by the perceived severity of the behavior, the coping strategy chosen and a difference in organizational status and gender between the perpetrator and the target of mistreatment. While our findings show that status differences were associated with a larger discrepancy regardless of the direction of the status differences, our results indicate that the mechanisms behind the discrepancy differed. Despite being a relatively high status population, faculty at a prestigious university responded more passively to mistreatment than desired, primarily due to situational constraints. Because the reasons for this discrepancy were often structural (i.e. based on organizational or social status structures), this research highlights the need for organizations to address mistreatment proactively, even in the absence of formal complaints.},

However, to avoid the surface positivity represented by the nonsustainable best-sellers, the case is made for positive organizational behavior (POB) to take advantage of the OB field's strength of being theory and research driven. Additional criteria for this version of POB are to identify unique, state-like psychological capacities that can not only be validly measured, but also be open to development and performance management. Confidence, hope, and resiliency are offered as meeting such POB inclusion criteria. The overall intent of the essay is to generate some positive thinking and excitement for the OB field and 'hopefully' stimulate some new theory building, research, and effective application.},

This study examined whether the relation between social status and perceived stress could explain the association between lower social status and increased risk of smoking. Methods: Data were collected from 1021 non-Hispanic black and white adolescents participating in a longitudinal school-based study. Students completed a questionnaire and parents provided information on their highest level of education. Hierarchical logistic regression estimated the effects of parental education, subjective social status (SSS), and stress on smoking risk. Results: At baseline, students from families without a college-educated parent were at greater risk of current smoking (odds ratio [OR] some college =1.98, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-3.67, and OR high school degree or less = 3.34, 95\% CI = 1.67-6.60). Higher school SSS decreased risk of current smoking (OR = .73, 95\% CI = .62-.87), and higher stress increased smoking risk (OR = 1.05, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.08). There was no evidence that the effects of parental education were mediated through stress. At one-year follow-up, both lower school SSS and higher baseline stress were significantly associated with smoking initiation in preliminary models, but only baseline stress (OR = 1.06, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.11) predicted smoking initiation in multivariable models. Discussion: These findings indicate that higher stress and lower social status increase risk of smoking, but that stress does not explain the association between lower social status and smoking. Therefore, stress reduction interventions may not alleviate social inequalities in teen smoking, but they do hold promise for youth smoking prevention. ?? 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.},

Although the importance of positive feelings has been recognized through the years in the academic OB and popular literature, both management scholars and practitioners have arguably too often taken a negative perspective—trying to fix what is wrong with managers and employees and concentrating on weaknesses. Positive organizational behavior (POB) follows the lead of recently emerging positive psychology, which is driven by theory and research focusing on people's strengths and psychological capabilities. Instead of just retreading and putting a positive spin on traditional OB concepts, this unveiling of POB sets forth specific criteria for inclusion. Not only does positivity have to be associated with the concept, but it must also be relatively unique to the OB field, have valid measures, be adaptable to leader/management and human resource training and development, and, most important, capable of contributing to performance improvement in today's workplace. The criteria-meeting concepts of confidence/self-efficacy, hope, optimism, subjective well-being/happiness, and emotional intelligence (or the acronym CHOSE) are identified and analyzed as most representative of the proposed POB approach.

	abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online in American Psychologist on Sep 16 2013 (see record 2013-32937-001). The hypothesis tested in this article was motivated, in part, by the nonlinear dynamic model introduced in Losada (1999) and advanced in Losada and Heaphy (2004) and herein (Fredrickson \& Losada, 2005). This model has since been called into question (Brown, Sokal, \& Friedman, 2013). Losada has chosen not to defend his nonlinear dynamic model in light of the Brown et al. critique. Fredrickson’s (2013) published response to the Brown et al. critique conveys that although she had accepted Losada’s modeling as valid, she has since come to question it. As such, the modeling element of this article is formally withdrawn as invalid and, along with it, the model-based predictions about the particular positivity ratios of 2.9 and 11.6. Other elements of the article remain valid and are unaffected by this correction notice, notably (a) the supporting theoretical and empirical literature, (b) the data drawn from two independent samples, and (c) the finding that positivity ratios were significantly higher for individuals identified as flourishing relative to those identified as nonflourishing.] Extending B. L. Fredrickson's (1998) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions and M. Losada's (1999) nonlinear dynamics model of team performance, the authors predict that a ratio of positive to negative affect at or above 2.9 will characterize individuals in flourishing mental health. Participants (N=188) completed an initial survey to identify flourishing mental health and then provided daily reports of experienced positive and negative emotions over 28 days. Results showed that the mean ratio of positive to negative affect was above 2.9 for individuals classified as flourishing and below that threshold for those not flourishing. Together with other evidence, these findings suggest that a set of general mathematical principles may describe the relations between positive affect and human flourishing.},

Items deal with 43 different behaviours related to bullying, harassment and emotional abuse in the workplace. The scale forms part of a more extensive instrument, the CISNEROS BarometerTM (Cuestionario Individual sobre PSicoterror, Negación, Estigmatización y Rechazo en Organizaciones Sociales; Individual Questionnaire on Psychoterror, Mobbing, Stigmatization and Rejection in Social Organizations), which includes 3 scales for exploring periodically the content and development of violence and harassment in the workplace in Spain. In this paper we analyze the reliability, validity and dimensionality of the Cisneros scale using data from a sample of 1,303 workers from different sectors. Results show that Cisneros has very high reliability (0.96) and a bidimensional structure that includes "Locus of bullying behaviour" and "Type of bullying behaviour", and that it presents expected and statistically significant correlations with scales measuring Self-esteem, Burnout, Depression, Intention to leave, and Post-traumatic Stress. It is concluded that Cisneros is capable of discriminating between different levels of bullying and harassment at work and can be considered a valuable tool to examine and establish the frequency and damage of mobbing at organizational or individual level.

However, some particular features of cyberbullying suggest that it may have a distinct causal pathway, due to the social context of a virtual environment within which peer social processes occur. Moreover, boys and girls may perceive and respond differentially to their social context, which may heighten the risk for victimisation. This study aimed to describe how the perceived relational context (school, peers and family)may influence the prob- ability of becoming a victim, in both offline and virtual contexts, among boys and girls. A questionnaire, measuring school climate; global, family and peer self-esteem; lone- liness in relationship with parents and peers; and victimisation in traditional direct, traditional indirect and cyberbullying,was completed by 2326 Italian adolescents (mean age 13.9 years). For traditional victimisation, significant predictors were loneliness in relations with peers and a negative perception of school climate, in both males and females, while younger age (for direct victimisation) and lower global self-esteem (for indirect victimisation) were predictors for males only. For cybervictimisation, involve- ment as either a direct or an indirect victim was a very strong predictor for both males and females, but with an element of distinction compared to traditional victimisation, as lower self-esteem in family relationships was a predictor of cybervictimisation for males, while parent loneliness was a predictor for females.

Methods: The sample included 2348 boys born in 1981. Information about bullying was gathered at the age of 8 from self, parent and teacher's reports. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed during the Finnish military call-up examination. Results: Based on regression models, boys who were bullies frequently, but not merely sometimes, were more likely to be severely depressed and to report suicidal ideation compared to boys who were not bullies. When controlling for depression at age 8 the association between frequent bullying and severe depression was maintained but the association with suicidal ideation became non-significant. Boys who were only victimized were not more likely to be depressed or to report suicidal ideation at age 18. Boys who were frequently both bullies and victims were found to be at risk for later depression. Limitations: Our finding can only be generalized to boys who were involved in bullying at elementary school age. Data at age 18 was based only on self-reports and the bullying/victimization questions were very general. Conclusions: Childhood bullying behavior is a risk factor for later depression. Screening and intervention for bullying behavior in the early school years is recommended to avoid subsequent internalizing problem in late adolescence. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Participants were 205 fifth-grade students and their parents. Students attended an urban, ethnically diverse school district in the Northeast. Youth completed self-report measures about bullying involvement, attitudes toward and responses to bullying, and victimization in the home. Parents responded to self-report survey questions about attitudes toward and responses to bullying, perceptions of their child's involvement in bullying, and family characteristics. Bullying perpetration and victimization rates were higher when reported by students than parents, and parents were particularly unaware of their children bullying others. Family support was related to students telling their parents about peer victimization and youth getting in trouble at home for bullying perpetration. Finally, victims' homes were characterized by higher levels of criticism, fewer rules, and more child maltreatment; bullies' homes were characterized by lack of supervision, child maltreatment, and exposure to domestic violence. Findings highlight the need to increase parental awareness about bullying and to include parents in school-based bullying prevention programs. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT},

Guided by the attribution model of social conduct (Weiner, 2006), a 2 × 2 vignette experiment was conducted. Participants were Dutch regional government employees (N = 161). Path analyses generally supported the hypotheses, but showed different results for women and men. In the strong (Vs. weak) responsibility condition, women reported less sympathy and more anger and men only more anger, which resulted in lower helping intention. Additionally, for men the results showed an unexpected direct positive effect of responsibility on helping intention. Furthermore, in the strong SBA condition, women and men reported more fear and men, unexpectedly, more anger. Consequently, helping intention decreased. The findings on gender are discussed in the context of social role theory, gender and emotion. Our findings suggest that to prevent and tackle mobbing, organizations and professionals should be aware of the attributional and emotional processes and gender differences in bystanders' helping behaviour.},

Boys’ involvement in bullying revealed that one in three students has bullied others at least sometimes in the previous three months, and one in six has been victimized at the same rate; victimization decreases with age. The family related risk factor (conflicting parents) was positively associated with bullying and with victimization (together with punitive parenting); the same applied for risk factor related to the individual ways of dealing with problems (emotionally oriented coping skills). Protective factors related to the family context (supportive and authoritative parents) and to the individual (problem solving coping skills) were negatively associated to bullying and victimization. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed a moderating effect of supportive parenting on punitive parenting and on emotionally oriented coping strategies in predicting victimization. Problem solving coping strategies helped buffer the negative impact of emotionally oriented coping strategies over bullying.

	abstract = {Peer victimization, especially appearance-related bullying, is a highly stressful experience for a young person and is associated with significant negative outcomes. Perhaps, the most common consequence of peer victimization in adolescence is lowered self-esteem. Evidence supports the role of low self-esteem as a non-specific risk factor and high self-esteem as a protective factor in the development of mental disorders and social problems in adolescence. Moreover, the literature indicates a robust negative relationship between avoidant coping (i.e. distracting oneself, wishing the situation would go away) and psychological well-being. In this paper, we test a mediational model of the associations between appearance-related victimization, avoidance coping and self-esteem in young Australian adolescents. Boys (N = 194) and girls (N = 185) with a mean age of 11 years completed measures assessing self-esteem, appearance-related victimization and styles of coping. The results showed that avoidant coping partially mediates the association between appearance-related bullying problems and self-esteem among young adolescents. This finding provides a specific target for psychosocial interventions in schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved)},

METHODS: The sample comprised 2540 boys born in 1981. Information about bullying and victimization was gathered in 1989 when the boys were 8 years old from parents, teachers, and children. Information about psychiatric disorders was based on military call-up examination and army registry when the subjects were 18 to 23 years old. RESULTS: In univariate logistic regression analysis, frequent bullying-only status predicted antisocial personality, substance abuse, and depressive and anxiety disorders; frequent victimization-only status predicted anxiety disorder, whereas frequent bully-victim status predicted antisocial personality and anxiety disorder. When controlled against the effects of parental education level and parent and teacher reports of emotional and behavioral symptoms by using Rutter scales, frequent victimization-only status predicted anxiety disorders, and frequent bullying-only predicted antisocial personality disorder, whereas frequent bully-victimization predicted both anxiety and antisocial personality disorder. Information about frequent bullying and victimization as primary screening for children at risk identified approximately 28\% of those with a psychiatric disorder 10 to 15 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Both bullying and victimization during early school years are public health signs that identify boys who are at risk of suffering psychiatric disorders in early adulthood. The school health and educational system has a central role to play in detecting these boys at risk.},

Parent–child conflict was found to be positively correlated to, and a potent predictor of both bullying and victimization; child disclosure was found to be negatively correlated to and also a potent predictor of bullying (not victimization), while parental monitoring, unlike earlier reports, was found to be statistically unrelated to either bullying or victimization.},

Results indicated that bullying and aggressive victimization were relatively stable across time, possibly due to temperamental factors. Changes in peer affiliation indicated that youngsters' casual contacts with peers initially decreased from primary to the beginning of middle school but recovered by the end of the year. Close relationships, however, decreased, and number of youngsters nominated as isolates increased. Being embedded in an affiliative network of peers, in turn, inhibited victimization. School environmental factors did not make significant contributions to bullying or victimization. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of social affiliations in minimizing victimization in early adolescence.

The data collection tool developed for collecting survey data have been devised by the researcher. NAQ scale was used for determining the level of mobbing behavior suffered by teachers and principals. Frequency (f), percentage (\%), arithmetic average, standard deviation, and t-test and Anova test techniques have been used for analyzing the data. The results were tested at p{\textless}.05 level. Four different categories were analyzed to find out the root causes of mobbing witnessed in primary education schools. Those aspects were “organizational causes”, “causes related to perpetrators,” “causes related to victims,” and “causes concerning social groups.” The results of the survey demonstrated that teachers and principals working for primary education schools are exposed to mobbing in all those four categories. An analysis based on the seniority of the respondents showed a meaningful difference between different brackets of seniority in terms of causes pertaining to organization, perpetrators, and victims. People whose length of service is between 13 and 24 years suffer more mobbing than those with a length of service up to 12 years. As regards career steps, there was a meaningful difference between career steps in terms of causes related to organization and perpetrators. Specialized teachers are exposed to mobbing more than other teachers as a result of organizational causes and causes pertaining to perpetrators.},

METHODS: The data for this study was taken from the second Danish Psychosocial Work Environment Study (DPWES). The sample consisted of 3,429 employees between 20 and 59-years. The response rate for the study was 60.4\%. RESULTS: The study showed that 8.3\% of the respondents had been bullied within the past year, 1.6\% of the sample reported daily to weekly bullying. Co-workers (71.5\%) and managers/supervisors (32.4\%) were most often reported as perpetrators of bullying, but bullying from subordinates (6\%) was also reported. We found significant differences in the prevalence of bullying for both occupational status and work process, a variable characterizing the employees main task in their job. Unskilled workers reported the highest prevalence of bullying, while managers/supervisors the lowest prevalence. People working with things (male-dominated occupations) and people working with clients/patients (female-dominated occupations) reported higher prevalence of bullying than people working with symbols or customers. No significant gender or age differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that types of work and gender ratio are risk factors in the onset of workplace bullying. Future studies should take into account the type of work and the gender ratio of the organization.},

	abstract = {Functionally equivalent genes may evolve heterogeneously across closely related taxa as a consequence of lineage-specific selective pressures. Such disparate evolutionary modes are especially prevalent in genes that encode postcopulatory reproductive proteins, presumably as a result of sexual selection. We might therefore expect genes that mediate reproduction prior to insemination to evolve in a similar manner. Plethodontid receptivity factor (PRF), a proteinaceous salamander pheromone produced by the male, increases female receptivity during courtship interactions. To test for lineage-specific differences in PRF's evolution, we intensively sampled PRF genes across the eastern Plethodon phylogeny (27 spp.; 34 populations) to compare gene diversification, rates of evolution, modes of selection, and types of amino acid substitution. Our analyses indicate that PRF evolutionary dynamics vary considerably from lineage to lineage. Underlying this heterogeneity, however, are two well-defined transitions in evolutionary mode. The first mode is representative of a typical protein profile, wherein neutral divergence and purifying selection are the dominant features. The second mode is characterized by incessant, cyclical evolution driven by positive selection. In this mode, the positively selected sites are bound by a limited assortment of acceptable amino acids that appear to evolve independently of other sites, resulting in a tremendous number of unique PRF alleles. Several of these selected sites are implicated in receptor binding. These sites are apparently involved in a molecular tango in which the male signal and female receptors coevolve within a confined molecular space. PRF's lineage-specific evolutionary dynamics, in combination with evidence of a molecular tango, highlight the molecular action of sexual selection on a chemical signal that is used during courtship.},

	abstract = {Natural selection maintains the integration and coordination of sets of phenotypic characters that collectively perform a task. In functional complexes in which characters span molecular to behavioral levels of organization, we might then expect similar modes of selection to produce similar patterns in evolutionary divergence at each level. To test this expectation, we diagnosed selection at behavioral, morphological, and molecular levels for courtship pheromone signaling by plethodontid salamanders. At the levels of morphology and behavior tens of millions of years of stasis (stabilizing selection) occur on each side of a transition from vaccination to olfactory delivery modes. As a proxy for the molecular level, we used plethodontid receptivity factor (PRF), a protein that is an active component of the pheromone. We cloned PRF from 12 Plethodon spp. spanning the delivery transition and obtained multiple alleles from each individual surveyed. Analyses of 61 alleles for PRF identified elevated nonsynonymous over synonymous substitution rates along lineages in a molecular phylogeny, and at 8\% of sites in the protein, indicating that positive (directional) selection has acted on this vertebrate pheromone gene. Structural models showed PRF is in a family of cytokines characterized by a four-alpha-helix bundle. Positive selection in PRF was associated with receptor binding sites that are under purifying selection in other cytokines of that family. The evolutionary dynamics of the plethodontid pheromone delivery complex consists of stabilizing selection on morphological and behavioral aspects of signal delivery but positive selection on the signal mediated by receptors. Thus, different selection modes prevail at different levels in this reproductive functional complex. Evolutionary studies of integrated sets of characters therefore require separate analyses of selective action at each level.},

In experiments in which they had a choice of four males, test females displayed a significant association preference for the most colourful male presented. Male coloration was independent of age, size, dominance, vocal activity and movement rate in these experiments, and females showed no significant association preference for any of these male characters. When they had females to choose among, test females displayed no association preference. In a concurrent field study in southeastern Michigan, paired males were significantly more colourful than males in the population at large. Variation in male plumage coloration is a function of dietary intake of carotenoid pigments. Female choice based on such a condition-dependent trait supports a key prediction of the honest advertisement model of intersexual seletion.},

Here, we review the empirical evidence that female mate preferences, like male ornaments, are condition dependent. We show accumulating support for the hypothesis that high quality females show the strongest mate preference. Nonetheless, this is still an infant field, and we highlight areas in need of more research, both theoretical and empirical.

	abstract = {Female multiple mating and alternative mating systems can decrease the opportunity for sexual selection. Sperm competition is often the outcome of females mating with multiple males and has been observed in many animals, and alternative reproductive systems are widespread among species with external fertilization and parental care. Multiple paternity without associated complex behaviour related to mating or parental care is also seen in simultaneously spawning amphibians and fishes that release gametes into water. Here we report 'clutch piracy' in a montane population of the common frog Rana temporaria, a reproductive behaviour previously unknown in vertebrates with external fertilization. Males of this species clasp the females and the pair deposits one spherical clutch of eggs. No parental care is provided. 'Pirate' males search for freshly laid clutches, clasp them as they would do a female and fertilize the eggs that were left unfertilized by the 'parental' male. This behaviour does not seem to be size-dependent, and some males mate with a female and perform clutch piracy in the same season. Piracy affected 84\% of the clutches and in some cases increased the proportion of eggs fertilized, providing direct fitness benefits both for the pirate males and the females. Sexual selection--probably caused by a strong male-biased sex ratio--occurs in this population, as indicated by size-assortative mating; however, clutch piracy may reduce its impact. This provides a good model to explore how alternative mating strategies can affect the intensity of sexual selection.},

Unfortunately, speciation biologists often consider sexual selection in isolation from natural selection, even though sexually selected traits evolve in an ecological context: both preferences and traits are often subject to natural selection. Conversely, while behavioural ecologists may address ecological effects on sexual communication, they rarely measure the consequences for population divergence. Herein, we review the empirical literature addressing the mechanisms by which natural selection and sexual selection can interact during speciation. We find that convincing evidence for any of these scenarios is thin. However, the available data strongly support various diversifying effects that emerge from interactions between sexual selection and environmental heterogeneity. We suggest that evaluating the evolutionary consequences of these effects requires a better integration of behavioural, ecological and evolutionary research.},

Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of the comparative evidence and find a small but significant positive overall correlation between sexual selection and speciation rate. However, we also find that effect size estimates are influenced by methodological choices. Analyses that included deeper phylogenetic nodes yielded weaker correlations, and different proxies for sexual selection showed different relationships with species richness. We discuss the biological and methodological implications of these findings.

Despite much recent focus on their conservation, diversification, and systematics, no previous phylogeny for the group has contained more than 522 species. However, numerous studies with limited taxon sampling have generated large amounts of partially overlapping sequence data for many species. Here, we combine these data and produce a novel estimate of extant amphibian phylogeny, containing 2871 species ({\textasciitilde}40\% of the known extant species) from 432 genera ({\textasciitilde}85\% of the {\textasciitilde}500 currently recognized extant genera). Each sampled species contains up to 12,712. bp from 12 genes (three mitochondrial, nine nuclear), with an average of 2563. bp per species. This data set provides strong support for many groups recognized in previous studies, but it also suggests non-monophyly for several currently recognized families, particularly in hyloid frogs (e.g., Ceratophryidae, Cycloramphidae, Leptodactylidae, Strabomantidae). To correct these and other problems, we provide a revised classification of extant amphibians for taxa traditionally delimited at the family and subfamily levels. This new taxonomy includes several families not recognized in current classifications (e.g., Alsodidae, Batrachylidae, Rhinodermatidae, Odontophrynidae, Telmatobiidae), but which are strongly supported and important for avoiding non-monophyly of current families. Finally, this study provides further evidence that the supermatrix approach provides an effective strategy for inferring large-scale phylogenies using the combined results of previous studies, despite many taxa having extensive missing data. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The chemical components of sex pheromones have been determined for more than a thousand moth species, but so far only a handful of genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds have been identified. For understanding the evolution of moth sexual communication, it is essential to know which genes are involved in the production of specific pheromone components and what controls the variation in their relative frequencies in the pheromone blend. We used a transcriptomic approach to characterize the pheromone gland of the Noctuid moth Heliothis virescens, an important agricultural pest, in order to obtain substantial general sequence information and to identify a range of candidate genes involved in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway. RESULTS: To facilitate identifying sets of genes involved in a broad range of processes and to capture rare transcripts, we developed our majority of ESTs from a normalized cDNA library of Heliothis virescens pheromone glands (PG). Combining these with a non-normalized library yielded a total of 17,233 ESTs, which assembled into 2,082 contigs and 6,228 singletons. Using BLAST searches of the NR and Swissprot databases we were able to identify a large number of putative unique gene elements (unigenes), which we compared to those derived from previous transcriptomic surveys of the larval stage of Heliothis virescens. The distribution of unigenes among GO Biological Process functional groups shows an overall similarity between PG and larval transcriptomes, but with distinct enrichment of specific pathways in the PG. In addition, we identified a large number of candidate genes in the pheromone biosynthetic pathways. CONCLUSION: These data constitute one of the first large-scale EST-projects for Noctuidae, a much-needed resource for exploring these pest species. Our analysis shows a surprisingly complex transcriptome and we identified a large number of potential pheromone biosynthetic pathway and immune-related genes that can be applied to population and systematic studies of Heliothis virescens and other Noctuidae.},

	abstract = {Pheromones have been found in species in almost every part of the animal kingdom, including mammals. Pheromones (a molecule or defined combination of molecules) are species-wide signals which elicit innate responses (though responses can be conditional on development as well as context, experience, and internal state). In contrast, signature mixtures, in invertebrates and vertebrates, are variable subsets of molecules of an animal's chemical profile which are learnt by other animals, allowing them to distinguish individuals or colonies. All signature mixtures, and almost all pheromones, whatever the size of molecules, are detected by olfaction (as defined by receptor families and glomerular processing), in mammals by the main olfactory system or vomeronasal system or both. There is convergence on a glomerular organization of olfaction. The processing of all signature mixtures, and most pheromones, is combinatorial across a number of glomeruli, even for some sex pheromones which appear to have 'labeled lines'. Narrowly specific pheromone receptors are found, but are not a prerequisite for a molecule to be a pheromone. A small minority of pheromones act directly on target tissues (allohormone pheromones) or are detected by non-glomerular chemoreceptors, such as taste. The proposed definitions for pheromone and signature mixture are based on the heuristic value of separating these kinds of chemical information. In contrast to a species-wide pheromone, there is no single signature mixture to find, as signature mixtures are a 'receiver-side' phenomenon and it is the differences in signature mixtures which allow animals to distinguish each other.},

To obtain a more comprehensive view of the metabolism and effective pharmacological components of Chinese brown frog skin, we constructed a non-normalized cDNA library from the skin. By sequencing cDNA clones at the 5' end, we obtained 5,976 high-quality EST sequences, which clustered into 512 contigs and 1379 singletons (in all 1,891 clusters). After BLAST searches of the protein and nucleic acid databases in GenBank, we found 46.7\% of clusters to have significant similarity to known sequences; 28\% matched Xenopus tropicalis ESTs and 29.1\% matched Xenopus laevis ESTs. Gene annotation results indicated that genes related to secretion and defensive function, such as ubiquitin, lectin, and proteinase inhibitors, are highly expressed in the skin. Whey acidic-domain proteins are also highly abundant in the skin. Furthermore, both a beta-defensin and a lysozyme are transcribed in the frog skin, providing antibacterial protection. Analyses of gene ontology and KEGG metabolic pathways indicated the physiological roles of Chinese brown frog skin.},

We studied the abilities of Leiopelma hamiltoni, a species evolutionarily basal to most living anurans, to communicate by means of chemosignals. We collected frogs in the field, held them in captivity for 72 It, and then tested their preferences for substrates that they had marked themselves to those marked by conspecifics. Individuals preferred paper towels that they had marked themselves to those marked by frogs collected from other home ranges. Preferences were greater, on average, when the conspecific had been collected farther away. Frogs did not discriminate between their own odor and those of other individuals with which they had shared a home range. Individuals preferred their own odor to a blank unmarked towel but also avoided odors of unfamiliar conspecifics when paired with a blank. The discovery of chemical communication in an archaic anuran offers a window into how frogs may have communicated before mechanisms of bioacoustic signaling evolved. We suggest, however, that chemical signaling may be widespread in anuran amphibians.},

Closely related species often differ dramatically in signaling traits, in spite of similarity in other morphological traits. The idea that reproductive isolation arises when male mating signals and female preferences differ among populations is an old one. However, until recently, there was almost no information on what generates diversity in mating signals and preferences. This is beginning to change, with emerging results that highlight the importance of habitat differences in generating this diversity. Such differences in ecology are at the root of one hypothesis for divergence in sexual signaling - sensory drive. The sensory drive hypothesis focuses on how communication systems adapt to local environments and predicts that divergence in communication systems will occur when environments differ. Reproductive isolation can arise as a byproduct of this adaptive divergence in behavior.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing evidence that sexual selection can drive speciation, the evolution of sexual signals in natural populations is far from being well-understood. Sexual signals evolve in response to a variety of factors. Some of the most important selective factors are conspecifics, transmission efficiency in a particular environment, detection by predators, and phylogenetic constraints. These factors have been addressed quite successfully in studies of single types of signals in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, it is less clear how multimodal signals evolve because the factors listed above will act on every component of the signaling system, and the relative weights of each type of signal must be taken into account. Species of Drosophila are excellent for such analyses because they are amenable to both phenotypic experimentation and genetic manipulation. This paper presents an approach that involves two analyses: studies of which signals are sexually selected within a species, and parallel studies of the signals that are involved in behavioral isolation between closely related species. If the same signal characteristics are involved in both processes, they would provide support for the hypothesis that sexual selection can drive speciation. This approach is illustrated with studies of Hawaiian Drosophila and a review of signals that could be sexually selected in Drosophila melanogaster.},

	abstract = {Pheromonal communication is widespread in salamanders and newts and may also be important in some frogs and toads. Several amphibian pheromones have been behaviorally, biochemically and molecularly identified. These pheromones are typically peptides or proteins. Study of pheromone evolution in plethodontid salamanders has revealed that courtship pheromones have been subject to continual evolutionary change, perhaps as a result of co-evolution between the pheromonal ligand and its receptor. Pheromones are detected by the vomeronasal organ and main olfactory epithelium. Chemosensory neurons express vomeronasal receptors or olfactory receptors. Frogs have relatively large numbers of vomeronasal receptors that are transcribed in both the vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium. Salamander vomeronasal receptors apparently are restricted to the vomeronasal organ. To date, no chemosensory ligands have been matched to vomeronasal receptors or olfactory receptors so it is unknown whether particular receptor types are (1) specialized for detection of pheromones versus other chemosignals, or (2) specialized for detection of volatile, nonvolatile, or water-borne chemosignals. Despite progress in understanding amphibian pheromonal communication, only a small fraction of amphibian species have been examined. Study of additional species of amphibians will indicate which traits related to pheromonal communication are evolutionarily conserved and which traits have diverged over time.},

We show here that the frog Leiopelma hamiltoni communicates through fecal chemosignals. When given a choice between their own and other individuals' feces, subjects spent more time near their own feces. Further, this effect was greatest when the conspecific was larger in body size, suggesting that information about size as well as individuality is communicated. Time spent near conspecific feces correlated negatively with the distance between the collection sites of the frogs. This correlation may reflect differential responses to the feces of frogs of varied levels of kinship and social familiarity: frogs may avoid nonrelatives and unfamiliar conspecifics. To test the hypothesis that frogs alter fecal production upon exposure to conspecific feces, we presented subjects with either one smear of their own and one smear of a conspecific's feces or two smears of their own feces. Frogs did not defecate more when exposed to conspecific feces. However, when the frogs did defecate, they placed their feces closer to the conspecific's feces than to their own. This supports our hypothesis that feces serve as signals to conspecifics. Visual and tactile cues were eliminated in our experiments. Our results show that the frog L. hamiltoni communicates with conspecifics through chemical signals. We suggest that chemical signaling may be widespread in anuran amphibians.},

We explored the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards in Central Spain. Results showed that these populations differed in morphology and in composition and proportion of chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males. Tongue-flick experiments indicated that male and female lizards discriminated and were more interested in scents of lizards from their own area (i.e., Northern versus Southern populations), but did not discriminate between all populations. Moreover, only males from the populations that are geographically located more far away preferred scent of females from their own population. These data suggest that, at least between some populations, there may be reproductive isolation mediated by chemical signals and cryptic speciation.},

Although most studies of chemosensory speciation concern sexual isolation mediated by pheromone divergence, especially in Drosophila and moth species, other chemically based behaviours (habitat choice, pollinator attraction) can also play an important role in speciation and are likely to do so in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate species. Adaptive divergence of chemosensory traits in response to factors such as pollinators, hosts and conspecifics commonly drives the evolution of chemical prezygotic barriers. Although the genetic basis of chemosensory speciation remains largely unknown, genomic approaches to chemosensory gene families and to enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways of signal compounds now provide new opportunities to dissect the genetic basis of these complex traits and of their divergence among taxa.},

These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.},

	abstract = {The ability to quantitatively survey the global behavior of transcriptomes has been a key milestone in the field of systems biology, enabled by the advent of DNA microarrays. While this approach has literally transformed our vision and approach to cellular physiology, microarray technology has always been limited by the requirement to decide, a priori, what regions of the genome to examine. While very high density tiling arrays have reduced this limitation for simpler organisms, it remains an obstacle for larger, more complex, eukaryotic genomes. The recent development of "next-generation" massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies by companies such as Roche (454 GS FLX), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II), and ABI (AB SOLiD) has completely transformed the way in which quantitative transcriptomics can be done. These new technologies have reduced both the cost-per-reaction and time required by orders of magnitude, making the use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many experimental approaches. One such method that has recently been developed uses MPS technology to directly survey the RNA content of cells, without requiring any of the traditional cloning associated with EST sequencing. This approach, called "RNA-seq", can generate quantitative expression scores that are comparable to microarrays, with the added benefit that the entire transcriptome is surveyed without the requirement of a priori knowledge of transcribed regions. The important advantage of this technique is that not only can quantitative expression measures be made, but transcript structures including alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, can also be identified. This article discusses the experimental approach for both sample preparation and data analysis for the technique of RNA-seq. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As RNA-seq becomes more affordable, whole genome transcriptional profiling is likely to become the platform of choice for species with good genomic sequences. As yet, a rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed and we are still in the stages of exploring the features of the data. RESULTS: We investigated the effect of transcript length bias in RNA-seq data using three different published data sets. For standard analyses using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the ability to call differentially expressed genes between samples is strongly associated with the length of the transcript. CONCLUSION: Transcript length bias for calling differentially expressed genes is a general feature of current protocols for RNA-seq technology. This has implications for the ranking of differentially expressed genes, and in particular may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway analysis and other multi-gene systems biology analyses.

	abstract = {We propose a novel classification of frogs in the family Mantellidae, based on published phylogenetic information and on a new analysis of molecular data. Our molecular tree for 53 mantellid species is based on 2419 base pairs of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, tRNAVal and cytochrome b genes, and of the nuclear rhodopsin gene. Because the genus Mantidactylus Boulenger sensu lato is confirmed to be paraphyletic with respect to Mantella Boulenger, and is highly diverse in morphology and reproductive biology, we propose to partition Mantidactylus into seven genera by elevating four subgenera to genus rank (Blommersia Dubois, Guibemantis Dubois, Spinomantis Dubois, and Gephyromantis Methuen) and creating two new genera (Boehmantis gen. n. and Wakea gen. n.). In addition, we create the new subgenera Boophis (Sahona) subgen. n., Gephyromantis (Duboimantis) subgen. n., G. (Vatomantis) subgen. n., and Mantidactylus (Maitsomantis) subgen. n. The following species are transferred to Spinomantis, based on their phylogenetic relationships: S. elegans (Guib??) comb. n. (formerly in Mantidactylus subgenus Guibemantis); S. bertini (Guib??) comb. n. and S. guibei (Blommers-Schl??sser) comb. n. (both formerly in Mantidactylus subgenus Blommersia); S. microtis (Guib??) comb. n. (formerly in Boophis Tschudi). Within Boophis, the new B. mandraka species group and B. albipunctatus species group are established. Boophis rhodoscelis (Boulenger) is transferred to the B. microtympanum group. The following five species are revalidated: Mantidactylus bellyi Mocquard and M. bourgati Guib?? (not junior synonyms of M. curtus (Boulenger)); M. cowanii (Boulenger) (not syn. M. lugubris (Dum??ril)); M. delormei Angel (not syn. M. brevipalmatus Ahl); Mantella ebenaui (Boettger) (not syn. M. betsileo (Grandidier)). The new classification accounts for recent progress in the understanding of the phylogeny and natural history of these frogs, but it is still tentative for a number of species. Future modifications may be necessary, especially as concerns species now included in Gephyromantis and Spinomantis.

Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results.

We estimated and mapped the distribution of each of the 220 described Malagasy species and applied, for the first time, the IUCN Red List categories and criteria to all species described at the time of the assessment. Nine species were categorized as critically endangered, 21 as endangered, and 25 as vulnerable. The most threatened species occur on the High Plateau and/or have been subjected to overcollection for the pet trade, but restricted extent of occurrence and ongoing habitat destruction were identified as the most important factors influencing extinction threats. The two areas with the majority of threatened species were the northern Tsaratanana-Marojejy-Masoala highlands and the southeastern Anosy Mountains. The current system of protected areas includes 82\% of the threatened amphibian species. Of the critically endangered species, 6 did not occur in any protected area. For conservation of these species we recommend the creation of a reserve for the species of the Mantella aurantiaca group, the inclusion of two Scaphiophryne species in the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix II, and the suspension of commercial collecting for Mantella cowani. Field surveys during the last 15 years reveal no pervasive extinction of Malagasy amphibians resulting from disease or other agents, as has been reported in some other areas of the world.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rapid evolution in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has opened up new perspectives in several research fields and led to the production of large volumes of sequence data. A fundamental step in HTS data analysis is the mapping of reads onto reference sequences. Choosing a suitable mapper for a given technology and a given application is a subtle task because of the difficulty of evaluating mapping algorithms.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In this paper, we present a benchmark procedure to compare mapping algorithms used in HTS using both real and simulated datasets and considering four evaluation criteria: computational resource and time requirements, robustness of mapping, ability to report positions for reads in repetitive regions, and ability to retrieve true genetic variation positions. To measure robustness, we introduced a new definition for a correctly mapped read taking into account not only the expected start position of the read but also the end position and the number of indels and substitutions. We developed CuReSim, a new read simulator, that is able to generate customized benchmark data for any kind of HTS technology by adjusting parameters to the error types. CuReSim and CuReSimEval, a tool to evaluate the mapping quality of the CuReSim simulated reads, are freely available. We applied our benchmark procedure to evaluate 14 mappers in the context of whole genome sequencing of small genomes with Ion Torrent data for which such a comparison has not yet been established.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: A benchmark procedure to compare HTS data mappers is introduced with a new definition for the mapping correctness as well as tools to generate simulated reads and evaluate mapping quality. The application of this procedure to Ion Torrent data from the whole genome sequencing of small genomes has allowed us to validate our benchmark procedure and demonstrate that it is helpful for selecting a mapper based on the intended application, questions to be addressed, and the technology used. This benchmark procedure can be used to evaluate existing or in-development mappers as well as to optimize parameters of a chosen mapper for any application and any sequencing platform.},

Considerably more genes were also detected using the contigs produced from normalised cDNA, and microsatellite discovery was up to 73\% more efficient in these. There was a positive correlation between the detected expression level of genes in normalised and unnormalised cDNA, and there was no difference in the number of genes identified as being differentially expressed between blood and spleen for the normalised and unnormalised libraries.

	abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a flexible technology for measuring genome-wide expression that is rapidly replacing microarrays as costs become comparable. Current differential expression analysis methods for RNA-seq data fall into two broad classes: (1) methods that quantify expression within the boundaries of genes previously published in databases and (2) methods that attempt to reconstruct full length RNA transcripts. The first class cannot discover differential expression outside of previously known genes. While the second approach does possess discovery capabilities, statistical analysis of differential expression is complicated by the ambiguity and variability incurred while assembling transcripts and estimating their abundances. Here, we propose a novel method that first identifies differentially expressed regions (DERs) of interest by assessing differential expression at each base of the genome. The method then segments the genome into regions comprised of bases showing similar differential expression signal, and then assigns a measure of statistical significance to each region. Optionally, DERs can be annotated using a reference database of genomic features. We compare our approach with leading competitors from both current classes of differential expression methods and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each. A software implementation of our method is available on github (https://github.com/alyssafrazee/derfinder).},

To address this challenge, we developed a model-based score, RSEM-EVAL, for evaluating assemblies when the ground truth is unknown. Our experiments show that RSEM-EVAL correctly reflects assembly accuracy, as measured by REF-EVAL, a refined set of ground-truth-based scores that we also developed. With the guidance of RSEM-EVAL, we assembled the transcriptome of the regenerating axolotl limb; this assembly compares favorably to a previous assembly.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing genome research, and in particular, their application to transcriptomics (RNA-seq) is increasingly being used for gene expression profiling as a replacement for microarrays. However, the properties of RNA-seq data have not been yet fully established, and additional research is needed for understanding how these data respond to differential expression analysis. In this work, we set out to gain insights into the characteristics of RNA-seq data analysis by studying an important parameter of this technology: the sequencing depth. We have analyzed how sequencing depth affects the detection of transcripts and their identification as differentially expressed, looking at aspects such as transcript biotype, length, expression level, and fold-change. We have evaluated different algorithms available for the analysis of RNA-seq and proposed a novel approach--NOISeq--that differs from existing methods in that it is data-adaptive and nonparametric. Our results reveal that most existing methodologies suffer from a strong dependency on sequencing depth for their differential expression calls and that this results in a considerable number of false positives that increases as the number of reads grows. In contrast, our proposed method models the noise distribution from the actual data, can therefore better adapt to the size of the data set, and is more effective in controlling the rate of false discoveries. This work discusses the true potential of RNA-seq for studying regulation at low expression ranges, the noise within RNA-seq data, and the issue of replication.},

A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-328},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq has shown huge potential for phylogenomic inferences in non-model organisms. However, error, incompleteness, and redundant assembled transcripts for each gene in de novo assembly of short reads cause noise in analyses and a large amount of missing data in the aligned matrix. To address these problems, we compare de novo assemblies of paired end 90 bp RNA-seq reads using Oases, Trinity, Trans-ABySS and SOAPdenovo-Trans to transcripts from genome annotation of the model plant Ricinus communis. By doing so we evaluate strategies for optimizing total gene coverage and minimizing assembly chimeras and redundancy.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We found that the frequency and structure of chimeras vary dramatically among different software packages. The differences were largely due to the number of trans-self chimeras that contain repeats in the opposite direction. More than half of the total chimeras in Oases and Trinity were trans-self chimeras. Within each package, we found a trade-off between maximizing reference coverage and minimizing redundancy and chimera rate. In order to reduce redundancy, we investigated three methods: 1) using cap3 and CD-HIT-EST to combine highly similar transcripts, 2) only retaining the transcript with the highest read coverage, or removing the transcript with the lowest read coverage for each subcomponent in Trinity, and 3) filtering Oases single k-mer assemblies by number of transcripts per locus and relative transcript length, and then finding the transcript with the highest read coverage. We then utilized results from blastx against model protein sequences to effectively remove trans chimeras. After optimization, seven assembly strategies among all four packages successfully assembled 42.9-47.1\% of reference genes to more than 200 bp, with a chimera rate of 0.92-2.21\%, and on average 1.8-3.1 transcripts per reference gene assembled.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: With rapidly improving sequencing and assembly tools, our study provides a framework to benchmark and optimize performance before choosing tools or parameter combinations for analyzing short-read RNA-seq data. Our study demonstrates that choice of assembly package, k-mer sizes, post-assembly redundancy-reduction and chimera cleanup, and strand-specific RNA-seq library preparation and assembly dramatically improves gene coverage by non-redundant and non-chimeric transcripts that are optimized for downstream phylogenomic analyses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social dominance is important for the reproductive success of males in many species. In the black-faced blenny (Tripterygion delaisi) during the reproductive season, some males change color and invest in nest making and defending a territory, whereas others do not change color and 'sneak' reproductions when females lay their eggs. Using RNAseq, we profiled differential gene expression between the brains of territorial males, sneaker males, and females to study the molecular signatures of male dimorphism.

RESULTS: We found that more genes were differentially expressed between the two male phenotypes than between males and females, suggesting that during the reproductive period phenotypic plasticity is a more important factor in differential gene expression than sexual dimorphism. The territorial male overexpresses genes related to synaptic plasticity and the sneaker male overexpresses genes involved in differentiation and development.

CONCLUSIONS: Previously suggested candidate genes for social dominance in the context of alternative mating strategies seem to be predominantly species-specific. We present a list of novel genes which are differentially expressed in Tripterygion delaisi. This is the first genome-wide study for a molecular non-model species in the context of alternative mating strategies and provides essential information for further studies investigating the molecular basis of social dominance.},

	abstract = {The study of functional genomics, particularly in non-model organisms, has been dramatically improved over the last few years by the use of transcriptomes and RNAseq. While these studies are potentially extremely powerful, a computationally intensive procedure, the de novo construction of a reference transcriptome must be completed as a prerequisite to further analyses. The accurate reference is critically important as all downstream steps, including estimating transcript abundance are critically dependent on the construction of an accurate reference. Though a substantial amount of research has been done on assembly, only recently have the pre-assembly procedures been studied in detail. Specifically, several stand-alone error correction modules have been reported on and, while they have shown to be effective in reducing errors at the level of sequencing reads, how error correction impacts assembly accuracy is largely unknown. Here, we show via use of a simulated and empiric dataset, that applying error correction to sequencing reads has significant positive effects on assembly accuracy, and should be applied to all datasets. A complete collection of commands which will allow for the production of Reptile corrected reads is available at https://github.com/macmanes/error\_correction/tree/master/scripts and as File S1.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Transcriptome sequencing has long been the favored method for quickly and inexpensively obtaining a large number of gene sequences from an organism with no reference genome. Owing to the rapid increase in throughputs and decrease in costs of next- generation sequencing, RNA-Seq in particular has become the method of choice. However, the very short reads (e.g. 2 × 90 bp paired ends) from next generation sequencing makes de novo assembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences an algorithmic challenge.

RESULTS: Here, we present SOAPdenovo-Trans, a de novo transcriptome assembler designed specifically for RNA-Seq. We evaluated its performance on transcriptome datasets from rice and mouse. Using as our benchmarks the known transcripts from these well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago), we assessed how SOAPdenovo-Trans and two other popular transcriptome assemblers handled such practical issues as alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion is that SOAPdenovo-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution.

	abstract = {The emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis is driven by the spread of amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd), a highly virulent pathogen threatening global amphibian biodiversity. Although pandemic in distribution, previous intensive field surveys have failed to detect Bd in Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot home to hundreds of endemic amphibian species. Due to the presence of Bd in nearby continental Africa and the ecological crisis that can be expected following establishment in Madagascar, enhanced surveillance is imperative. I sampled 565 amphibians commercially exported from Madagascar for the presence of Bd upon importation to the USA, both to assist early detection efforts and demonstrate the conservation potential of wildlife trade disease surveillance. Bd was detected in three animals via quantitative PCR: a single Heterixalus alboguttatus, Heterixalus betsileo, and Scaphiophryne spinosa. This is the first time Bd has been confirmed in amphibians from Madagascar and presents an urgent call to action. Our early identification of pathogen presence prior to widespread infection provides the necessary tools and encouragement to catalyze a swift, targeted response to isolate and eradicate Bd from Madagascar. If implemented before establishment occurs, an otherwise likely catastrophic decline in amphibian biodiversity may be prevented.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-15-287},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intron-derived long noncoding RNAs with snoRNA ends (sno-lncRNAs) are highly expressed from the imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) region on human chromosome 15. However, sno-lncRNAs from other regions of the human genome or from other genomes have not yet been documented.

RESULTS: By exploring non-polyadenylated transcriptomes from human, rhesus and mouse, we have systematically annotated sno-lncRNAs expressed in all three species. In total, using available data from a limited set of cell lines, 19 sno-lncRNAs have been identified with tissue- and species-specific expression patterns. Although primary sequence analysis revealed that snoRNAs themselves are conserved from human to mouse, sno-lncRNAs are not. PWS region sno-lncRNAs are highly expressed in human and rhesus monkey, but are undetectable in mouse. Importantly, the absence of PWS region sno-lncRNAs in mouse suggested a possible reason why current mouse models fail to fully recapitulate pathological features of human PWS. In addition, a RPL13A region sno-lncRNA was specifically revealed in mouse embryonic stem cells, and its snoRNA ends were reported to influence lipid metabolism. Interestingly, the RPL13A region sno-lncRNA is barely detectable in human. We further demonstrated that the formation of sno-lncRNAs is often associated with alternative splicing of exons within their parent genes, and species-specific alternative splicing leads to unique expression pattern of sno-lncRNAs in different animals.

CONCLUSIONS: Comparative transcriptomes of non-polyadenylated RNAs among human, rhesus and mouse revealed that the expression of sno-lncRNAs is species-specific and that their processing is closely linked to alternative splicing of their parent genes. This study thus further demonstrates a complex regulatory network of coding and noncoding parts of the mammalian genome.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is a valuable fish for aquaculture in China. This fish exhibits sexual dimorphism, particularly different growth rates and body sizes between two genders. Thus, C. semilaevis is a good model that can be used to investigate mechanisms responsible for such dimorphism, this model can also be utilized to answer fundamental questions in evolution and applied fields of aquaculture. Hence, advances in second-generation sequencing technology, such as 454 pyrosequencing, could provide a robust tool to study the genome characteristics of non-model species.

RESULTS: In this study, C. semilaevis was subjected to de novo transcriptome sequencing and characterization. A total of 749,954 reads were generated using a single 454 sequencing run in a full PicoTiter plate. These reads were then assembled into 62,632 contigs with a 10-fold average sequencing coverage. A total of 26,589 sequences were successfully annotated based on sequence similarities; among these sequences, 3,451 transcripts exhibited gene ontology terms and 2,362 showed enzyme commissions associated with 186 pathways from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathways. A search of repetitive elements was performed, and 1,898 transposable elements were identified. Approximately 7,800 simple-sequence repeats and 21,234 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also detected.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data provided an integrated and comprehensive transcriptome resource for C. semilaevis. These data could be used for further research in population genetics, gene function, and tissue-specific gene expressions.},

Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of the transcripts present in the data, also reporting alternative splice isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. In all cases, Trinity performs better than other available transcriptome assembly programs, and its sensitivity is comparable to methods relying on genome alignments.

In addition, though many assembly tools are available now, it is unclear whether the existing assemblers perform well enough for all data with different transcriptome complexities. In this paper, we studied these two open problems using two high-performing assemblers, Velvet/Oases and Trinity, on several simulated datasets of human, mouse and S.cerevisiae. The results suggest that (1) the read length of paired reads does not matter once it exceeds a certain threshold, and interestingly, the threshold is distinct in different organisms; (2) the quality of de novo assembly decreases sharply with the increase of transcriptome complexity, all existing de novo assemblers tend to corrupt whenever the genes contain a large number of alternative splicing events.},

Transcriptome sequencing offers an attractive method to gather information about genes and gene expression without the need for a reference genome. However, it is unclear what sequencing depth is adequate to assemble the transcriptome de novo for these purposes.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We assembled transcriptomes of animals from six different phyla (Annelids, Arthropods, Chordates, Cnidarians, Ctenophores, and Molluscs) at regular increments of reads using Velvet/Oases and Trinity to determine how read count affects the assembly. This included an assembly of mouse heart reads because we could compare those against the reference genome that is available. We found qualitative differences in the assemblies of whole-animals versus tissues. With increasing reads, whole-animal assemblies show rapid increase of transcripts and discovery of conserved genes, while single-tissue assemblies show a slower discovery of conserved genes though the assembled transcripts were often longer. A deeper examination of the mouse assemblies shows that with more reads, assembly errors become more frequent but such errors can be mitigated with more stringent assembly parameters.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: These assembly trends suggest that representative assemblies are generated with as few as 20 million reads for tissue samples and 30 million reads for whole-animals for RNA-level coverage. These depths provide a good balance between coverage and noise. Beyond 60 million reads, the discovery of new genes is low and sequencing errors of highly-expressed genes are likely to accumulate. Finally, siphonophores (polymorphic Cnidarians) are an exception and possibly require alternate assembly strategies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a lot of studies have been published dealing with the anatomy of the nervous system in different spiralian species. The only nemertean species investigated in this context probably shows derived characters and thus the conditions found there are not useful in inferring the relationship between nemerteans and other spiralian taxa. Ingroup relationships within Nemertea are still unclear, but there is some agreement that the palaeonemerteans form a basal, paraphyletic grade. Thus, palaeonemertean species are likely the most informative when comparing with other invertebrate groups. We therefore analyzed the nervous system of several palaeonemertean species by combining histology and immunostaining. 3D reconstructions based on the aligned slices were performed to get an overall impression of the central nervous system, and immunohistochemistry was chosen to reveal fine structures and to be able to compare the data with recently published results. The insights presented here permit a first attempt to reconstruct the primary organization of the nemertean nervous system. This comparative analysis allows substantiating homology hypotheses for nerves of the peripheral nervous system. This study also provides evidence that the nemertean brain primarily consists of two lobes connected by a strong ventral commissure and one to several dorsal commissures. During nemertean evolution, the brain underwent continuous compartmentalization into a pair of dorsal and ventral lobes interconnected by commissures and lateral tracts. Given that this conclusion can be corroborated by cladistic analyses, nemerteans should share a common ancestor with spiralians that primarily have a simple brain consisting of paired medullary, frontally commissurized and reinforced cords. Such an organization resembles the situation found in presumably basally branching annelids or mollusks.},

Specimens were collected from 0 to 20m depths along Apulian coast (Mediterranean Sea). Species collected at shallowest depth showed the presence of microalgae and macroalgae fragments in their guts and were considered herbivores. A prevalence of sediment grains in species from deeper samples together with animal or vegetal detritus, suggest that these are detritivores. Finally some species, collected at different depths, appeared as a mixture of the two previous categories and were considered omnivores. In addition in the omnivores, as well as in the detritivores, spicules of sponges or ascidians (Didemnidae) and bryozoan fragments could be present. Some assumptions were inferred from correlation of feeding structures with feeding categories in syllids. This paper represents a preliminary study, but it intends to warn against broad generalizations. Previous studies of trophic guilds, based on assumptions inferred from a few and old papers relative mainly to the genus Autolytus, considered all the Syllidae as mostly carnivores. Our observations suggest that the syllids are much more various in their diet than previously assumed, and that several of them are not carnivores.},

	abstract = {Pluripotent cells in the embryo can generate all cell types, but lineage-restricted cells are generally thought to replenish adult tissues. Planarians are flatworms and regenerate from tiny body fragments, a process requiring a population of proliferating cells (neoblasts). Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts. We conclude that broadly distributed, adult pluripotent stem cells underlie the remarkable regenerative abilities of planarians.},

	abstract = {The planarian was established as a system for the study of regenerative development more than 200 years ago. As attention shifted towards organisms with more rigid patterns of development, and molecular and genetic techniques gained popularity, planarians fell out of favour. Planarians show remarkable developmental plasticity. For example, a planarian can regenerate from a piece of tissue that represents less than 1/279 of the adult organism. They also de-grow in nutritionally limiting conditions and can shrink to a size that is smaller than their size at hatching. De-growth is accompanied by loss of reproductive structures, which re-form when nutrition becomes plentiful again. Developmental plasticity is dependent on a population of pluripotent cells called neoblasts. Neoblasts are thought to represent stem cells and are stimulated to migrate, grow and divide by discontinuities in the adult structure. Planarians therefore have great potential as a model system for studying stem-cell biology. Genetic markers have recently become available that will help to study neoblasts, and to determine, for example, whether the cells are a homogeneous population or consist of a collection of lineage-restricted cells. Further technological improvements in this system have been the development of methods for in situ hybridization, the successful application of RNA interference and an accumulation of genomic resources. The current fascination with stem-cell biology, along with the technological advances in planarians, has set the stage for a resurgence of interest in these organisms. Planarians could provide important insights into the mechanisms that underlie regeneration and development.},

We have examined the cellular dynamics of neoblasts during the posterior regeneration of Macrostomum lignano. Double-labeling of neoblasts with bromodeoxyuridine and the anti-phospho histone H3 mitosis marker has revealed a complex cellular response in the first 48 h after amputation; this response is different from that known to occur during regeneration in triclad platyhelminths and in starvation/feeding experiments in M. lignano. Mitotic activity is reduced during the first 8 h of regeneration but, at 48 h after amputation, reaches almost twice the value of control animals. The total number of S-phase cells significantly increases after 1 day of regeneration. A subpopulation of fast-cycling neoblasts surprisingly shows the same dynamics during regeneration as those in control animals. Wound healing and regeneration are accompanied by the formation of a distinct blastema. These results present new insights, at the cellular level, into the early regeneration of rhabditophoran Platyhelminthes.},

Evidence presented here from experiments utilizing techniques of radioautography, histochemistry, X-irradiation, and electron microscopy in addition to histological observation largely supports the last hypothesis. In the light of recent experiments, it appears that the new epidermis and gut arise from the corresponding old tissue. The formation of the mesoderm cannot yet be generalized, but reports indicate that it may arise from dedifferentiated muscle cells, cells of the peritoneal epithelium, and free coelomocytes.},

	abstract = {Abstract After amputation, the wound is closed by the protrusion and lateral expansion of the alimentary canal over the cut muscles and its final fusion with the epidermis laterally after about twenty-four hours. Associated with the expansion is a divergence of the two adjacent halves of the ventral nerve cord in the last remaining segment. As a result, the whole of the new regenerated lobe behind the ring of the cut epidermis is interneural; i.e., it is an enlargement of the normally small area separating the two nerve cords. Undifferentiated cells, or neuroblasts, are normally located interneurally, and during regeneration these neoblasts proliferate throughout the enlarged interneural zone of the papilla and migrate throughout the lobe. At first the neoblastic mesenchyme filling the lobe is loose and homogeneous, but as the cells settle down against the outer wall they replace the old intestinal cells and assume the characters of new epidermis. Internally, the mass acquires paired cavities, while the cells surrounding the cavities differentiate into muscle, peritoneum, etc. Thus one type of cell gives rise to the whole of the regenerated papilla. These cells are also the mother cells of the gametocytes.},

	abstract = {Since first described, acoels were considered members of the flatworms (Platyhelminthes). However, no clear synapomorphies among the three large flatworm taxa - the Catenulida, the Acoelomorpha and the Rhabditophora - have been characterized to date. Molecular phylogenies, on the other hand, commonly positioned acoels separate from other flatworms. Accordingly, our own multi-locus phylogenetic analysis using 43 genes and 23 animal species places the acoel flatworm Isodiametra pulchra at the base of all Bilateria, distant from other flatworms. By contrast, novel data on the distribution and proliferation of stem cells and the specific mode of epidermal replacement constitute a strong synapomorphy for the Acoela plus the major group of flatworms, the Rhabditophora. The expression of a piwi-like gene not only in gonadal, but also in adult somatic stem cells is another unique feature among bilaterians. These two independent stem-cell-related characters put the Acoela into the Platyhelminthes-Lophotrochozoa clade and account for the most parsimonious evolutionary explanation of epidermal cell renewal in the Bilateria. Most available multigene analyses produce conflicting results regarding the position of the acoels in the tree of life. Given these phylogenomic conflicts and the contradiction of developmental and morphological data with phylogenomic results, the monophyly of the phylum Platyhelminthes and the position of the Acoela remain unresolved. By these data, both the inclusion of Acoela within Platyhelminthes, and their separation from flatworms as basal bilaterians are well-supported alternatives.},

In this Review, we discuss how the arthropod segmentation clock generates a repeating sequence of pair-rule gene expression, and how this is converted into a segment-polarity pattern by ‘timing factor’ wavefronts associated with axial extension. We argue that the gene regulatory network that patterns segments may be relatively conserved, although the timing of segmentation varies widely, and double-segment periodicity appears to have evolved at least twice. Finally, we describe how the repeated evolution of a simultaneous (Drosophila-like) mode of segmentation within holometabolan insects can be explained by heterochronic shifts in timing factor expression plus extensive pre-patterning of the pair-rule genes.},

	abstract = {Although some animals are capable of regenerating organs, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are poorly understood. In planarians, pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts supply new cells for growth, replenish tissues in response to cellular turnover, and regenerate tissues after injury. For most tissues and organs, however, the spatiotemporal dynamics of stem cell differentiation and the fate of tissue that existed prior to injury have not been characterized systematically. Utilizing in vivo imaging and bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experiments, we have analyzed growth and regeneration of the planarian intestine, the organ responsible for digestion and nutrient distribution. During growth, we observe that new gut branches are added along the entire anteroposterior axis. We find that new enterocytes differentiate throughout the intestine rather than in specific growth zones, suggesting that branching morphogenesis is achieved primarily by remodeling of differentiated intestinal tissues. During regeneration, we also demonstrate a previously unappreciated degree of intestinal remodeling, in which pre-existing posterior gut tissue contributes extensively to the newly formed anterior gut, and vice versa. By contrast to growing animals, differentiation of new intestinal cells occurs at preferential locations, including within newly generated tissue (the blastema), and along pre-existing intestinal branches undergoing remodeling. Our results indicate that growth and regeneration of the planarian intestine are achieved by co-ordinated differentiation of stem cells and the remodeling of pre-existing tissues. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which these processes are integrated will be critical for understanding organogenesis in a post-embryonic context.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary explanations for life history diversity are based on the idea of costs of reproduction, particularly on the concept of a trade-off between age-specific reproduction and parental survival, and between expenditure on current and future offspring. Such trade-offs are often difficult to detect in population studies of wild mammals. Terminal investment theory predicts that reproductive effort by older parents should increase, because individual offspring become more valuable to parents as the conflict between current versus potential future offspring declines with age. In order to demonstrate this phenomenon in females, there must be an increase in maternal expenditure on offspring with age, imposing a fitness cost on the mother. Clear evidence of both the expenditure and fitness cost components has rarely been found. In this study, we quantify costs of reproduction throughout the lifespan of female antechinuses. Antechinuses are nocturnal, insectivorous, forest-dwelling small (20–40 g) marsupials, which nest in tree hollows. They have a single synchronized mating season of around three weeks, which occurs on predictable dates each year in a population. Females produce only one litter per year. Unlike almost all other mammals, all males, and in the smaller species, most females are semelparous. We show that increased allocation to current reproduction reduces maternal survival, and that offspring growth and survival in the first breeding season is traded-off with performance of the second litter in iteroparous females. In iteroparous females, increased allocation to second litters is associated with severe weight loss in late lactation and post-lactation death of mothers, but increased offspring growth in late lactation and survival to weaning. These findings are consistent with terminal investment. Iteroparity did not increase lifetime reproductive success, indicating that terminal investment in the first breeding season at the expense of maternal survival (i.e. semelparity) is likely to be advantageous for females.},

	abstract = {The remarkable totipotent stem-cell-based regeneration capacities of the Platyhelminthes have brought them into the focus of stem cell and regeneration research. Although selected platyhelminth groups are among the best-studied invertebrates, our data provide new insights into regenerative processes in the most basally branching group of the Platyhelminthes, the Catenulida. The mouth- and gutless free-living catenulid flatworm Paracatenula galateia harbors intracellular bacterial symbionts in its posterior body region, the trophosome region, accounting for up to 50\% of the volume. Following decapitation of this flatworm, we have analyzed the behavior of the amputated fragments and any anterior and posterior regeneration. Using an EdU-pulse-chase/BrdU-pulse thymidine analog double-labeling approach combined with immunohistochemistry, we show that neoblasts are the main drivers of the regeneration processes. During anterior (rostrum) regeneration, EdU-pulse-chase-labeled cells aggregate inside the regenerating rostrum, whereas BrdU pulse-labeling before fixation indicates clusters of S-phase neoblasts at the same position. In parallel, serotonergic nerves reorganize and the brain regenerates. In completely regenerated animals, the original condition with S-phase neoblasts being restricted to the body region posterior to the brain is restored. In contrast, no posterior regeneration or growth of the trophosome region in anterior fragments cut a short distance posterior to the brain has been observed. Our data thus reveal interesting aspects of the cellular processes underlying the regeneration of the emerging catenulid-bacteria symbiosis model P. galateia and show that a neoblast stem cell system is indeed a plesiomorphic feature of basal platyhelminths.},

	abstract = {Wnt genes and beta-catenin signaling are involved in axial patterning processes in  vertebrate embryogenesis in setting up the Spemann-Mangold organizer in amphibian  embryos. An organizer with a similar function is present in the hypostome of an  adult Hydra polyp. Previously, a Hydra ortholog of Wnt3 (HyWnt3), which is expressed  in the hypostome, has been described. Here, ten additional Hydra Wnt genes have been  identified. Of these, six (HyWnt1, -7, -9/10a, -9/10c, -11, and -16) are expressed  in the adult hypostome. And, as is HyWnt3, these six Wnt genes are also expressed  when a new head organizer is formed during head regeneration and bud formation. The  kinetics of Wnt gene expressions during head regeneration suggests that a cascade of  consecutive Wnt activation accompanies regeneration, and HyWnt3 begins this cascade.  Recombinant HyWnt3 protein induced body column tissue to undergo head formation. It  also increased the head formation capacity in the head regeneration-deficient mutant  strain reg-16 to that of wild-type strains. In addition our data reveal striking  similarities in the molecular basis of the organizer in Hydra and axis polarization  in chordates (e.g. Spemann's organizer) as well as it's role in regeneration  suggesting a conserved function of Wnt signaling in setting up this ancient metazoan  signaling center.},

	abstract = {Summary
Whole-body regeneration relies on the re-establishment of body axes for patterning of new tissue. Wnt signaling is required to correctly regenerate tissues along the primary axis in many animals. However, the causal mechanisms that first launch Wnt signaling during regeneration are poorly characterized. We use the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia to identify processes that initiate Wnt signaling during posterior regeneration and find that the ligand wnt-3 is upregulated early in posterior-facing wounds. Functional studies reveal that wnt-3 is required to regenerate posterior tissues. wnt-3 is expressed in stem cells, it is needed for their proliferation, and its function is stem cell dependent. Chromatin accessibility data reveal that wnt-3 activation requires input from the general wound response. In addition, the expression of a different Wnt ligand, wnt-1, before amputation is required for wound-induced activation of wnt-3. Our study establishes a gene regulatory network for initiating Wnt signaling in posterior tissues in a bilaterian.},

Evidence from Hydra and the sea anemone, Nematostella, demonstrates a  role for Wnt signaling in axis formation and patterning, as well as gastrulation and  germ-layer specification.

A large body of evidence supports speculation that pharmacological inhibitors of GSK-3 could be used to treat several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, bipolar affective disorder, diabetes, and diseases caused by unicellular parasites that express GSK-3 homologues. The toxicity, associated side-effects and concerns regarding the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of these inhibitors affect their clinical potential. More than 30 inhibitors of GSK-3 have been identified. Seven of these have been co-crystallized with GSK-3β and all localize within the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme. GSK-3, as part of a multi-protein complex that contains proteins such as axin, presenilin and β-catenin, contains many additional target sites for specific modulation of its activity.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-13-134},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important  factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the  intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in  certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired  amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two  stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either  manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate  nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential  targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many  details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched  bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The  complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult  task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits.  Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target  detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local  alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over  the entire primer range. RESULTS: We present a new software tool called Primer-BLAST  to alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers. This tool combines  BLAST with a global alignment algorithm to ensure a full primer-target alignment and  is sensitive enough to detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches  to primers. Primer-BLAST allows users to design new target-specific primers in one  step as well as to check the specificity of pre-existing primers. Primer-BLAST also  supports placing primers based on exon/intron locations and excluding single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in primers. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a robust  and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool that designs  target-specific PCR primers. Primer-BLAST offers flexible options to adjust the  specificity threshold and other primer properties. This tool is publicly available  at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast.},

In addition, there is a non-segmental part at the front end, the prostomium, and one at the back, the pygidium. New segments develop in a prepygidial proliferation zone. Each segment contains four groups of chaetae made up of β-chitin, a pair of coelomic cavities separated by mesenteries, and septa. The nervous system is a rope-ladder-like ventral nerve cord with a dorsal brain in the prostomium. For the last stem species a trochophore larva and a benthic adult are commonly postulated. There are two conflicting hypotheses describing the systematization of Annelida: the first postulates a sister-group relationship of Polychaeta and Clitellata, the second sees Clitellata as a highly derived taxon forming a subordinate taxon within the polychaetes which, consequently, are regarded as paraphyletic. Depending on the hypothesis, different characters have to be postulated for the stem species of Annelida. Besides segmentation other characters such as nuchal organs, palps and antennae, body wall musculature, cuticle, parapodia as well as structure of the central nervous system and the foregut play an important role in this discussion. Here, the different characters and character states are critically reviewed and analyzed with respect to morphology and function. The consequences for systematization of their phylogenetic interpretation as autapomorphies, synapomorphies or plesiomorphies are outlined. The resulting hypotheses are compared with those relying on molecular data sets.},

	abstract = {Annelida comprises an ancient and ecologically important animal phylum with over 16,500 described species and members are the dominant macrofauna of the deep sea. Traditionally, two major groups are distinguished: Clitellata (including earthworms, leeches) and "Polychaeta" (mostly marine worms). Recent analyses of molecular data suggest that Annelida may include other taxa once considered separate phyla (i.e., Echiura, and Sipuncula) and that Clitellata are derived annelids, thus rendering "Polychaeta" paraphyletic; however, this contradicts classification schemes of annelids developed from recent analyses of morphological characters. Given that deep-level evolutionary relationships of Annelida are poorly understood, we have analyzed comprehensive datasets based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and have applied rigorous testing of alternative hypotheses so that we can move towards the robust reconstruction of annelid history needed to interpret animal body plan evolution.},

	abstract = {As in other clitellate annelids, embryonic development in the oligochaete Tubifex is characterized by the generation of five bilateral pairs of teloblasts (designated M, N, O, P and Q), which serve as embryonic stem cells to produce germ bands on either side of the embryo. A large part of the tissues comprising body segments has been assigned to the progenies of the teloblasts; however, the developmental fate of each teloblast has been inferred only from its initial position in the embryo. In the present study, the fate of the progenies of each teloblast was followed by means of intracellular injection of a tracer enzyme, horseradish peroxidase. Cell fate maps for teloblasts in the Tubifex embryo were constructed. M teloblasts gave rise to nearly all of the mesodermal tissues, which included circular and longitudinal muscles, coelomic walls, nephridia (in segments VII and VIII) and primordial germ cells (in segments X and XI). Although few in number, M teloblasts also contributed cells to the ventral ganglion. Similarly, each of the ectoteloblasts, N, O, P and Q, made a topographically characteristic contribution to the ectodermal tissues such as the nervous system (i.e. ganglionic cells and peripheral neurones) and epidermis, all of which exhibited a segmentally repeated distribution pattern. The P and Q teloblasts uniquely gave rise to additional ectodermal tissues, namely ventral and dorsal setal sacs, respectively. Furthermore, O teloblasts made a contribution to the nephridiopores in segments VII and VIII as well. These results confirm the previously held view that ectoteloblasts and mesoteloblasts are the main source of ectodermal and mesodermal segmental tissues, respectively, but also suggest that all of the teloblasts produce more types of tissue than has previously been thought.},

Here we present  experimental evidence that senescence occurs in the asexually reproducing marine  oligochaete Paranais litoralis. We also analyze data reported in Sonneborn's  classical study and show that the rhabdocoel Stenostomum incaudatum undergoes  senescence. We argue that the stability of commitment to somatic function and the  fact that asexual metazoans form their germ cells from undifferentiated stem cells  are sufficient to allow for senescence of the asexual metazoan's soma. Thus the  evolution of somatic differentiation, and not germ-line sequestration, would be the  necessary condition for the evolution of senescence.},

In two mouse models, topical treatment of  senescence-free wounds with recombinant PDGF-AA rescued the delayed wound closure  and lack of myofibroblast differentiation.

Here we show that, surprisingly, there is a significant induction of cellular senescence during salamander limb regeneration, but that rapid and effective mechanisms of senescent cell clearance operate in normal and regenerating tissues. Furthermore, the number of senescent cells does not increase upon repetitive amputation or ageing, in contrast to mammals. Finally, we identify the macrophage as a critical player in this efficient senescent cell clearance mechanism.

Different stimuli can trigger senescence but excessive production or impaired clearance of these cells can lead to their accumulation during aging with deleterious effects. Despite this potential negative side of cell senescence, its physiological role as a pro-regenerative and morphogenetic force has emerged recently after the identification of programmed cell senescence during embryogenesis and during wound healing and limb regeneration. Here, we explored the conservation of tissue injury-induced senescence in a model of complex regeneration, the zebrafish. Fin amputation in adult fish led to the appearance of senescent cells at the site of damage, and their removal impaired tissue regeneration. Despite many conceptual similarities, this tissue repair response is different from developmental senescence. Our results lend support to the notion that cell senescence is a positive response promoting tissue repair and homeostasis.},

A more satisfactory approach to investigate the role of somatic damage accumulation in aging would be to manipulate experimentally the levels of somatic repair and observe its effect on longevity. Here I report the results of studies in the asexual annelid Paranais litoralis where I have experimentally extended the worms' lifespan by subjecting them to repeated injury.

In almost all cases, individuals or clones with greater present reproduction have as great or greater an expectation of future reproduction. The bdelloid rotifer Philodina was an exception to this rule, these being a strong negative correlation between early fecundity and longevity for individuals within a clone.

	abstract = {[The cost hypothesis states that any increment in present reproduction is associated with a decrement in the expectation of future reproduction. It is crucial to the theory of life histories, but has yet to receive clear and general support from empirical studies. This support may be provided by passive experiments, in which the correlation between life-history variables is measured when systematic variation due to genotype or environment has been eliminated or controlled, or by manipulative experiments, in which the fate of individuals whose reproduction has been altered is compared with that of control individuals. Either type of experiment might demonstrate a relationship between present fecundity and survival (the survival cost) or between present and future fecundity (the fecundity cost). These costs might be caused directly (variable costs), in which case they will be detected by comparing the future performance of genetically identical individuals with different present reproduction, or they might have become genetically programmed (acquired costs) as the result of selection acting through the variable costs, and will be detected by comparing the mean performance of different genotypes. The passive experiment described here used the life tables of 15 clones of the rotifer Platyias patulus to study the variable and acquired survival and fecundity costs. The negative correlations predicted by the cost hypothesis were not found in any case; instead, correlations tended to be positive. This result might be attributable to the peculiarities of the organism; to the procedural details of the experiment; to the general inappropriateness of the laboratory situation; to fundamental logical flaws in the design of passive experiments; to the fallacy or incompleteness of the cost hypothesis; or to the fallacy of the Darwinian interpretation of life histories. A program of experimentation designed to sift these possibilities is outlined.]},

	abstract = {The ground pattern underlying the nervous system of the last common ancestor in annelids was long thought to be settled, consisting of a dorsal brain, circumoesophageal connectives and a subepithelial, ladder-like ventral nerve cord with segmental ganglia connected by paired connectives. With the advent of immunocytochemical stainings and confocal laser scanning microscopy, it becomes evident that its architecture is extremely diverse, which makes the reconstruction of a ground pattern in annelida challenging. Whereas the nervous systems of many different families has already been described, only very few studies looked at the diversity of nervous systems within such clades to give a closer estimate on how plastic the annelid nervous system really is. So far, little is known on syllid nervous system architecture, one of the largest and most diverse groups of marine annelids.},

This can potentially be accomplished using the processes of dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation or reprogramming.During dedifferentiation, a terminally differentiated cell reverts back to a less-differentiated stage from within its own lineage, which allows it to proliferate. Many regenerative processes have been associated with dedifferentiation.Transdifferentiation sees cells regress to a point when they can switch lineages or can also occur directly between two different cell types.Reprogramming aims to induce differentiated cells into reverting to pluripotency. From here, they can differentiate into almost any cell type.During dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation, well-defined intermediate cell types have been identified. The process of reprogramming seems to be largely stochastic.Dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation can be successfully achieved in vivo, and reprogramming facilitates genetic manipulation such as correcting disease-inducing mutations.},

	abstract = {The polychaetes of the family Cirratulidae (Annelida) are common inhabitants in continental shelf benthic environments and considered an important group of organisms in environmental monitoring surveys. The family represents a taxonomic and systematic challenge, as monophyly of genera and evolutionary relationships within the family remain to be explored in a proper phylogenetic framework. Bitentaculate cirratulids, especially the genus Chaetozone, form one of the most species-diverse group of polychaetes worldwide. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the species diversity of the genus Chaetozonein benthic environments in the North East Atlantic by molecular means. We tested whether traditional morphological diagnostic characters are able to discriminate between the species hypothesis after species delimitation analyses, and assessed monophyly of the genera involved. Two DNA markers were sequenced from about 200 specimens belonging to Chaetozone, Aphelochaeta, Dodecaceria, Cirriformia and Cirratulus – the universal mitochondrial barcoding region COI, and the D1-D2 regions of the nuclear 28S rRNA – and analyzed with Bayesian inference, Maximum Likelihood and the species delimitation methods mPTP and GMYC. The first phylogeny of the family Cirratulidae is inferred and the genera Chaetozone, Dodecaceria and Cirratulus are recovered monophyletic. A total of 14 clusters of sequences – corresponding to species of Chaetozone – were found in the study area, and only one of them is here referred to a nominal species, Chaetozone setosa. Our results reveal several species complexes in the genus Chaetozone, that some of these independent lineages are unnamed and undescribed, and that morphological diagnostic features are in most cases unable to discriminate between the most similar species.},

It is therefore necessary to use a combination of characters to make an accurate identification. The present work is the first of a planned revision of the genus Cirratulus from coastal zones of Argentina. The examined material came from the two largest natural history museums of the country, and showed several morphotypes. Some specimens corresponded to described species, but others were undoubtedly undescribed. Among the previously known Cirratulidae, Cirratulus jucundus (Kinberg, 1866) and Cirratulus patagonicus (Kinberg, 1866), formerly distributed for Antarctica are now also present in coastal continental areas of Argentina. The new species Cirratulus mianzanii sp. nov. is described from subtidal areas off Peninsula Valdés, Patagonia. This species is distinguished from its congeners by the segmental origin of both tentacular filaments and first pair of branchiae in the junction between the peristomium and first chaetiger. Branchiae arise some distance from the notopodium but not at the dorsal midline of the body. Ventral groove present along the body, with a fine dark midline. Capillary chaetae are serrate seen under an optical microscope, and the segmental origin of neuro- and notopodial spines is different from other species of the genus.},

	abstract = {Syllidae is an annelid family characterized by its complex life cycles involving some of the most outstanding annelid reproductive strategies. Syllid reproductive modes sometimes imply the modification of the posterior body to form independent reproductive units (schizogamy) or the development of swimming adults (epigamy). These modes of sexual reproduction have been studied for more than 150 years, and yet, little is known regarding their molecular background. Notably, while several studies during the last three decades have revealed details about molecular mechanisms involved in the reproduction of some few model annelids, studies focusing on syllids remain limited. Thus, we performed differential gene expression analyses of female, male, and non-reproducing individuals of Syllis prolifera (schizogamic) and Nudisyllis pulligera (epigamic), as representatives of two different reproductive strategies. For that, transcriptomes from specimens of three conditions (non-reproducing, male, female) were de novo assembled and annotated for S. prolifera and N. pulligera. We found rather similar gene expression profiles for female and non-reproducing individuals, while male gene expression is clearly different. Although previous studies have suggested that femininity in syllids might require additional signalling, our analyses support a scenario, where masculinity may also involve several specific genetic processes.},

	abstract = {Background Although polychaetes are one of the dominant taxa in marine communities, their distributions and taxonomic diversity are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that many species thought to have broad distributions are actually a complex of allied species. In Canada, 12\% of polychaete species are thought to occur in Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans, but the extent of gene flow among their populations has not been tested.   Methodology/Principal Findings Sequence variation in a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene was employed to compare morphological versus molecular diversity estimates, to examine gene flow among populations of widespread species, and to explore connectivity patterns among Canada's three oceans. Analysis of 1876 specimens, representing 333 provisional species, revealed 40 times more sequence divergence between than within species (16.5\% versus 0.38\%). Genetic data suggest that one quarter of previously recognized species actually include two or more divergent lineages, indicating that richness in this region is currently underestimated. Few species with a tri-oceanic distribution showed genetic cohesion. Instead, large genetic breaks occur between Pacific and Atlantic-Arctic lineages, suggesting their long-term separation. High connectivity among Arctic and Atlantic regions and low connectivity with the Pacific further supports the conclusion that Canadian polychaetes are partitioned into two distinct faunas.   Conclusions/Significance Results of this study confirm that COI sequences are an effective tool for species identification in polychaetes, and suggest that DNA barcoding will aid the recognition of species overlooked by the current taxonomic system. The consistent geographic structuring within presumed widespread species suggests that historical range fragmentation during the Pleistocene ultimately increased Canadian polychaete diversity and that the coastal British Columbia fauna played a minor role in Arctic recolonization following deglaciation. This study highlights the value of DNA barcoding for providing rapid insights into species distributions and biogeographic patterns in understudied groups.},

This myth invariably provokes the question: Did the ancient Greeks know about the liver's amazing capacity for self-repair? The authors address this question by exploring the origins of Greek myth and medicine, adopting a 2-fold strategy. First, the authors consider what opportunities the ancient Greeks had to learn about the liver's structure and function. This involves a discussion of early battlefield surgery, the beginnings of anatomical research, and the ancient art of liver augury. In addition, the authors consider how the Greeks understood Prometheus' immortal liver. Not only do the authors examine the general theme of regeneration in Greek mythology, they survey several scholarly interpretations of Prometheus' torture.},

Tissue regeneration shares certain hallmarks of embryonic development, in that lineage-specific factors can be repurposed upon injury to initiate morphogenesis; however, many differences exist between regeneration and embryogenesis. Recent studies of regenerating tissues in laboratory model organisms — such as acoel worms, frogs, fish and mice — have revealed that chromatin structure, dedicated enhancers and transcriptional networks are regulated in a context-specific manner to control key gene expression programmes. A deeper mechanistic understanding of the gene regulatory networks of regeneration pathways might ultimately enable their targeted reactivation as a means to treat human injuries and degenerative diseases. In this Review, we consider the regeneration of body parts across a range of tissues and species to explore common themes and potentially exploitable elements.},

There is little  empirical evidence to support either view, but some of the best comes from recent  phylogenetic analyses of regenerative ability in Planarians which reveals that this  property has been lost and gained several times in this group. In addition, a  non-regenerating species has been induced to regenerate by altering only one  signaling pathway. Extrapolating this to mammals it may be the case that there is  more regenerative ability in mammals than has typically been thought to exist and  that inducing regeneration in humans may not be as impossible as it may seem. The  regenerative abilities of mammals is described and it turns out that there are  several examples of classical epimorphic regeneration involving a blastema as  exemplified by the regenerating Urodele limb that can be seen in mammals. Even the  heart can regenerate in mammals which has long been considered to be a property  unique to Urodeles and fish and several recent examples of regeneration have come  from recent studies of the spiny mouse, Acomys, which are discussed here. It is  suggested that a much more thorough phylogenetic analysis of mammalian regeneration  would likely reveal some important insights into the evolution of regeneration.},

Many organisms can regenerate, and arthropod limbs are no exception although their  ability to regenerate is a product shaped by natural and sexual selection. Recent  studies have begun to uncover cellular and molecular processes underlying limb  regeneration in several arthropod species. Here we argue that an evo-devo approach  to the study of arthropod limb regeneration is needed to understand aspects of limb  regeneration that are conserved and divergent. In particular, we argue that limbs of  different species are comprised of cells at distinct stages of differentiation at  the time of limb loss and therefore provide insights into regeneration involving  both stem cell-like cells/precursor cells and differentiated cells. In addition, we  review recent studies that demonstrate how limb regeneration impacts the development  of the whole organism and argue that studies on the link between local tissue damage  and the rest of the body should provide insights into the integrative nature of  development. Molecular studies on limb regeneration are only beginning to take off,  but comparative studies on the mechanisms of limb regeneration across various taxa  should not only yield interesting insights into development but also answer how this  remarkable ability evolved across arthropods and beyond.},

During the period of regeneration, the newly formed tissue initially contains only undifferentiated cells but subsequently differentiates into a variety of cell types including muscle, nerve and vasculature. Transcriptomics analysis, reported previously, provided a number of candidate non-coding RNAs that were induced during regeneration. We found that one such long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is expressed in the skin, only at the base of newly formed chaetae. The spatial organization and precise arrangement of the regenerating chaetae and the cells expressing the lncRNA on the ventral side clearly support a model wherein the regenerating tissue contains a zone of growth and cell division at the tip and a zone of differentiation at the site of amputation. The temporal expression pattern of the lncRNA, named Neev, closely resembled the pattern of chitin synthase genes, implicated in chaetae formation. We found that the lncRNA has 49 sites for binding a set of four microRNAs (miRNAs) while the chitin synthase 8 mRNA has 478 sites. The over-representation of shared miRNA sites suggests that lncRNA Neev may act as a miRNA sponge to transiently de-repress chitin synthase 8 during formation of new chaetae in the regenerating segments of Eisenia fetida.},

Temporal gene expression trajectories identify transcriptional regulatory factors that are potentially crucial for initiating cell proliferation and differentiation during regeneration. Furthermore, early growth response genes related to regeneration are transcriptionally activated in both the earthworm and planarian.

	abstract = {Abstract The sponge-dwelling Syllidae Ramisyllis multicaudata and Syllis ramosa are the only annelid species for which a branched body with one head and multiple posterior ends is known. In these species, the head is located deep within the sponge, and the branches extend through the canal system of their host. The morphology of these creatures has captivated annelid biologists since they were first discovered in the late XIXth century, and their external characteristics have been well documented. However, how their branched bodies fit within their symbiotic host sponges and how branches translate into internal anatomy has not been documented before. These features are crucially relevant for understanding the body of these animals and, therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate these aspects. In order to assess these questions, live observation, as wells as histology, immunohistochemistry, micro-computed tomography, and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used on specimens of R. multicaudata. By using these techniques, we show that the complex body of R. multicaudata specimens extends greatly through the canal system of their host sponges. We demonstrate that iterative external bifurcation of the body is accompanied by the bifurcation of the longitudinal organ systems that are characteristic of annelids. Additionally, we also highlight that the bifurcation process leaves an unmistakable fingerprint in the form of newly-described ?muscles bridges?. These structures theoretically allow one to distinguish original and derived branches at each bifurcation. Last, we characterize some of the internal anatomical features of the stolons (reproductive units) of R. multicaudata, particularly their nervous system. Here, we provide the first study of the internal anatomy of a branched annelid. This information is not only crucial to deepen our understanding of these animals and their biology, but it will also be key to inform future studies that try to explain how this morphology evolved.},

	abstract = {Definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) monolayer cultures has been limited by poor cell survival or low efficiency. Recently, a combination of TGFβ and Wnt activation with BMP inhibition improved DE induction in embryoid bodies cultured in suspension. Based on these observations we developed a protocol to efficiently induce DE cells in monolayer cultures of mESCs. We obtained a good cell yield with 54.92\% DE induction as shown by Foxa2, Sox17, Cxcr4 and E-Cadherin expression. These DE-cells could be further differentiated into posterior foregut and pancreatic phenotypes using a culture protocol initially developed for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation. In addition, this mESC-derived DE gave rise to hepatocyte-like cells after exposure to BMP and FGF ligands. Our data therefore indicate a substantial improvement of monolayer DE induction from mESCs and support the concept that differentiation conditions for mESC-derived DE are similar to those for hESCs. As mESCs are easier to maintain and manipulate in culture compared to hESCs, and considering the shorter duration of embryonic development in the mouse, this method of efficient DE induction on monolayer will promote the development of new differentiation protocols to obtain DE-derivatives, like pancreatic beta-cells, for future use in cell replacement therapies.},

The initiation of such fates is often seen in the G1 phase. The aim of this review is to describe an integrative model of G1 phase progression and cell fate determination. Along the G1 phase, the cell will encounter an early checkpoint after which apoptosis can result. For a quiescent state and for differentiation, the cell will exit G1 before the restriction point and a subsequent differentiation checkpoint will decide the fate of the cell, quiescence or differentiation. After the restriction point, the cell can be arrested in response to stress stimuli, such as telomere depletion, and a decision between senescence and apoptosis occurs.},

	abstract = {The rapid turnover of the mammalian intestinal epithelium is supported by stem cells located around the base of the crypt. In addition to the Lgr5 marker, intestinal  stem cells have been associated with other markers that are expressed  heterogeneously within the crypt base region. Previous quantitative clonal fate  analyses have led to the proposal that homeostasis occurs as the consequence of  neutral competition between dividing stem cells. However, the short-term behaviour  of individual Lgr5(+) cells positioned at different locations within the crypt base  compartment has not been resolved. Here we establish the short-term dynamics of  intestinal stem cells using the novel approach of continuous intravital imaging of  Lgr5- Confetti mice. We find that Lgr5(+) cells in the upper part of the niche  (termed 'border cells') can be passively displaced into the transit-amplifying  domain, after the division of proximate cells, implying that the determination of  stem-cell fate can be uncoupled from division. Through quantitative analysis of  individual clonal lineages, we show that stem cells at the crypt base, termed  'central cells', experience a survival advantage over border stem cells. However,  through the transfer of stem cells between the border and central regions, all  Lgr5(+) cells are endowed with long-term self-renewal potential. These findings  establish a novel paradigm for stem-cell maintenance in which a dynamically  heterogeneous cell population is able to function long term as a single stem-cell  pool.},

	abstract = {Abstract Colonial ascidians are the only chordates to undergo whole body regeneration (WBR), the ability to form an entirely new individual from the peripheral vasculature. Here we describe WBR in Botrylloides violaceus, a colonial ascidian that reliably regenerates after ablation of all zooids and buds of young colonies. During early regeneration several buds develop within the tunic vasculature, but only one continues development into a complete zooid. We describe some of the first events of vascular budding leading to the vesicle stage with phase contrast microscopy, time-lapse video recording and detailed histological studies of regenerating colonies. The first conspicuous stage of vascular budding is when a single-layered sphere of cells becomes enclosed by vascular epithelium. We report the appearance of Piwi-positive cells in hemocytes surrounding the regenerates. We observed an increase of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in circulatory hemocytes in late regenerates, and found double-labeled nuclear expression with Piwi in a subset of large circulatory cells. We rarely found Piwi or PCNA in differentiating tissues during vascular budding, suggesting that cells that form the epithelial tissues during budding and WBR originate mostly from circulatory hemocyte precursors. We propose that multiple stem cell types are circulating within B. violaceus and that they undergo proliferation in the peripheral vasculature before differentiating into epithelial tissues for all three germ layers during WBR.

	abstract = {The trade-off between survival and reproduction is the bedrock of the evolutionary theory of ageing. The reproductive system regulates ageing of the  soma, and removal of germ cells extends somatic lifespan and increases resistance  to a broad variety of abiotic and biotic stresses. The general explanation for  this somatic response is that reduced reproduction frees up resources for  survival. Remarkably, however, the disruption of molecular signaling pathways  that regulate ageing increases lifespan without the obligatory reduction in  fecundity, thus challenging the key role of the survival-reproduction trade-off.  Here, we review the diverse literature on the costs of lifespan extension and  suggest that the current paradigm is overly centered on the trade-off between  lifespan and fecundity, often neglecting key aspects of fitness, such as  development time, defense against parasites and, in particular, the high costs of  germline maintenance. Compromised germline maintenance increases germline  mutation rate, which reduces offspring fitness and ultimately can terminate  germline proliferation across generations. We propose that future work should  incorporate the costs of germline maintenance in the study of ageing evolution,  as well as in applied biomedical research, by assessing offspring fitness.},

	abstract = {Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest that can be triggered in normal cells in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, as well as developmental signals. Senescence is considered to be a highly dynamic, multi-step process, during which the properties of senescent cells continuously evolve and diversify in a context dependent manner. It is associated with multiple cellular and molecular changes and distinct phenotypic alterations, including a stable proliferation arrest unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli. Senescent cells remain viable, have alterations in metabolic activity and undergo dramatic changes in gene expression and develop a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Cellular senescence can compromise tissue repair and regeneration, thereby contributing toward aging. Removal of senescent cells can attenuate age-related tissue dysfunction and extend health span. Senescence can also act as a potent anti-tumor mechanism, by preventing proliferation of potentially cancerous cells. It is a cellular program which acts as a double-edged sword, with both beneficial and detrimental effects on the health of the organism, and considered to be an example of evolutionary antagonistic pleiotropy. Activation of the p53/p21$^{\textrm{WAF1/CIP1}}$ and p16$^{\textrm{INK4A}}$/pRB tumor suppressor pathways play a central role in regulating senescence. Several other pathways have recently been implicated in mediating senescence and the senescent phenotype. Herein we review the molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular senescence and the senescence associated growth arrest with a particular focus on why cells stop dividing, the stability of the growth arrest, the hypersecretory phenotype and how the different pathways are all integrated.},

Increasing  evidence suggests that caloric restriction extends longevity and retards  age-related diseases at least in part by reducing metabolic rate and oxidative  stress in a variety of species, including yeast, worms, flies, and mice.  Moreover, recent studies in invertebrates - worms and flies, highlight the  intricate interrelation between reproductive longevity and somatic aging (known  as disposable soma theory of aging), which appears to be conserved in  vertebrates. This review is specifically focused on how the reproductive system  modulates somatic aging and vice versa in genetic model systems. Since many  signaling pathways governing the aging process are evolutionarily conserved,  similar mechanisms may be involved in controlling soma and reproductive aging in  vertebrates.

Several ‘rejuvenating’ interventions have been proposed to delay ageing and the onset of age-associated decline and disease to extend healthspan and lifespan. These interventions include metabolic manipulation, partial reprogramming, heterochronic parabiosis, pharmaceutical administration and senescent cell ablation. As the ageing process is associated with altered epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodelling, and non-coding RNAs, the manipulation of these mechanisms is central to the effectiveness of age-delaying interventions. This Review discusses the epigenetic changes that occur during ageing and the rapidly increasing knowledge of how these epigenetic mechanisms have an effect on healthspan and lifespan extension, and outlines questions to guide future research on interventions to rejuvenate the epigenome and delay ageing processes.},

Senescent cells accumulate in  various tissues and organs over time, and have been speculated to have a role in  ageing. To explore the physiological relevance and consequences of naturally  occurring senescent cells, here we use a previously established transgene,  INK-ATTAC, to induce apoptosis in p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells of wild-type mice  by injection of AP20187 twice a week starting at one year of age. We show that  compared to vehicle alone, AP20187 treatment extended median lifespan in both  male and female mice of two distinct genetic backgrounds. The clearance of  p16(Ink4a)-positive cells delayed tumorigenesis and attenuated age-related  deterioration of several organs without apparent side effects, including kidney,  heart and fat, where clearance preserved the functionality of glomeruli,  cardio-protective KATP channels and adipocytes, respectively. Thus,  p16(Ink4a)-positive cells that accumulate during adulthood negatively influence  lifespan and promote age-dependent changes in several organs, and their  therapeutic removal may be an attractive approach to extend healthy lifespan.},

	abstract = {Exceptionally long-lived species, including many bats, rarely show overt signs of aging, making it difficult to determine why species differ in lifespan. Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from 712 known-age bats, representing 26 species, to identify epigenetic changes associated with age and longevity. We demonstrate that DNAm accurately predicts chronological age. Across species, longevity is negatively associated with the rate of DNAm change at age-associated sites. Furthermore, analysis of several bat genomes reveals that hypermethylated age- and longevity-associated sites are disproportionately located in promoter regions of key transcription factors (TF) and enriched for histone and chromatin features associated with transcriptional regulation. Predicted TF binding site motifs and enrichment analyses indicate that age-related methylation change is influenced by developmental processes, while longevity-related DNAm change is associated with innate immunity or tumorigenesis genes, suggesting that bat longevity results from augmented immune response and cancer suppression.},

We investigated this aspect in the marine bristleworm,  Platynereis dumerilii, a species where sexual maturation is tightly regulated by  both metabolic state and lunar cycle. Our specific focus was on ligands and  receptors of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. Members of  this superfamily are key in triggering sexual maturation in vertebrates but also  regulate reproductive processes and energy homeostasis in invertebrates. Here we  show that 3 of the 4 gnrh-like (gnrhl) preprohormone genes are expressed in  specific and distinct neuronal clusters in the Platynereis brain. Moreover,  ligand-receptor interaction analyses reveal a single Platynereis corazonin  receptor (CrzR) to be activated by CRZ1/GnRHL1, CRZ2/GnRHL2, and GnRHL3  (previously classified as AKH1), whereas 2 AKH-type hormone receptors  (GnRHR1/AKHR1 and GnRHR2/AKHR2) respond only to a single ligand (GnRH2/GnRHL4).  Crz1/gnrhl1 exhibits a particularly strong up-regulation in sexually mature  animals, after feeding, and in specific lunar phases. Homozygous crz1/gnrhl1  knockout animals exhibit a significant delay in maturation, reduced growth, and  attenuated regeneration. Through a combination of proteomics and gene expression  analysis, we identify enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism as  transcriptional targets of CRZ1/GnRHL1 signaling. Our data suggest that  Platynereis CRZ1/GnRHL1 coordinates glycoprotein turnover and energy homeostasis  with growth and sexual maturation, integrating both metabolic and developmental  demands with the worm's monthly cycle.},

Here we describe first a cytochemical protocol suitable for the histochemical detection of individual senescent cells both in culture and tissue biopsies. The second method is based on the alkalinization of lysosomes, followed by the use of 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside (C12FDG), a fluorogenic substrate for βgal activity. The cytochemical method takes about 30 min to execute, and several hours to a day to develop and score. The fluorescence methods take between 4 and 8 h to execute and can be scored in a single day. The cytochemical method is applicable to tissue sections and requires simple reagents and equipment. The fluorescence-based methods have the advantages of being more quantitative and sensitive.},

We hypothesise that therapy-induced senescence and senescence progression via bystander effects are significant causes of this premature ageing phenotype. Accordingly, the study addresses the question whether a short anti-senescence intervention is able to block progression of radiation-induced frailty and disability in a pre-clinical setting. Male mice were sublethally irradiated at 5 months of age and treated (or not) with either a senolytic drug (Navitoclax or dasatinib + quercetin) for 10 days or with the senostatic metformin for 10 weeks. Follow-up was for 1 year. Treatments commencing within a month after irradiation effectively reduced frailty progression (p{\textless}0.05) and improved muscle (p{\textless}0.01) and liver (p{\textless}0.05) function as well as short-term memory (p{\textless}0.05) until advanced age with no need for repeated interventions. Senolytic interventions that started late, after radiation-induced premature frailty was manifest, still had beneficial effects on frailty (p{\textless}0.05) and short-term memory (p{\textless}0.05). Metformin was similarly effective as senolytics. At therapeutically achievable concentrations, metformin acted as a senostatic neither via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, nor via improvement of mitophagy or mitochondrial function, but by reducing non-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production via NADPH oxidase 4 inhibition in senescent cells. Our study suggests that the progression of adverse long-term health and quality-of-life effects of radiation exposure, as experienced by cancer survivors, might be rescued by short-term adjuvant anti-senescence interventions.},

Another part of the traditional view is that the process of aging is at least partly due to accumulated damage done by these harmful species. However, recent workers in this and in related fields are exploring the view that superoxide radical and reactive oxygen species exert beneficial effects. Thus, such ROS are viewed as involved in cellular regulation by acting as (redox) signals, and their harmful effects are seen mostly as a result of compromised signaling, rather than due to direct damage to sensitive targets. According to some followers of this view, ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are not just causative agents of aging but may also be agents that increase the life span by acting, for example, as prosurvival signals. The goal of this review is to recall that many of the effects of ROS that are interpreted as beneficial may actually represent adaptations to toxicity and that some of the most extravagant recent claims may be due to misinterpretation, oversimplification, and ignoring the wealth of knowledge supporting the traditional view. Whether it is time to abandon the free radical (oxidative stress) theory of aging is considered.},

In C. elegans, removing the germ cells extends life span by triggering the nuclear localization and activation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the intestine. In this study, we identify and analyze genes required for germline removal to extend life span. We find that the reproductive system communicates with the intestine through lipophilic-hormone signaling and that a gene called kri-1 is likely to act in the intestine to promote DAF-16 nuclear localization in response to this signal. This lipophilic-signaling pathway and kri-1 are not required for DAF-16's nuclear localization and life-span extension in animals with decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Thus, this pathway specifically enables the integration of cues from the reproductive system with central DAF-16-activation pathways to influence the aging of the animal.},

To characterize cellular identities across an entire body, we have compared the transcriptomes of single cells randomly picked from dissociated whole larvae of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We identify five transcriptionally distinct groups of differentiated cells, each expressing a unique set of transcription factors and effector genes that implement cellular phenotypes. Spatial mapping of cells into a cellular expression atlas, and wholemount in situ hybridization of group-specific genes reveals spatially coherent transcriptional domains in the larval body, comprising, for example, apical sensory-neurosecretory cells versus neural/epidermal surface cells. These domains represent new, basic subdivisions of the annelid body based entirely on differential gene expression, and are composed of multiple, transcriptionally similar cell types. They do not represent clonal domains, as revealed by developmental lineage analysis. We propose that the transcriptional domains that subdivide the annelid larval body represent families of related cell types that have arisen by evolutionary diversification.

By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in Platynereis heads between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar clock phase.

ACME uses affordable reagents, can be done in most laboratories and even in the field, and thus will accelerate our knowledge of cell types across the tree of life.},

	abstract = {Summary
Cellular senescence is a state of irreversibly arrested proliferation, often induced by genotoxic stress [1]. Senescent cells participate in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, including tumor suppression [2], embryonic development [3, 4], tissue repair [5, 6, 7, 8], and organismal aging [9]. The senescence program is variably characterized by several non-exclusive markers, including constitutive DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βgal) activity, increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p16INK4A (CDKN2A) and p21CIP1 (CDKN1A), increased secretion of many bio-active factors (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP), and reduced expression of the nuclear lamina protein LaminB1 (LMNB1) [1]. Many senescence-associated markers result from altered transcription, but the senescent phenotype is variable, and methods for clearly identifying senescent cells are lacking [10]. Here, we characterize the heterogeneity of the senescence program using numerous whole-transcriptome datasets generated by us or publicly available. We identify transcriptome signatures associated with specific senescence-inducing stresses or senescent cell types and identify and validate genes that are commonly differentially regulated. We also show that the senescent phenotype is dynamic, changing at varying intervals after senescence induction. Identifying novel transcriptome signatures to detect any type of senescent cell or to discriminate among diverse senescence programs is an attractive strategy for determining the diverse biological roles of senescent cells and developing specific drug targets.},

We have identified variants and expansions of genes associated with replication, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, redox environment, stem cell population, and intercellular communication. Moreover, we have found silencing of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets and activation of pluripotency targets during LCR, which points to these transcription factors as pluripotency inducers in T. dohrnii. Accordingly, we propose these factors as key elements in the ability of T. dohrnii to undergo rejuvenation.},

This is due, in part, to the  complexity of the aging process and its multifactorial nature, the paucity of  animal models that lend themselves to unbiased high-throughput screening for  aging phenotypes, and the difficulty of predicting such phenotypes at an early  age. We suggest that the zebrafish genetic model offers a unique opportunity to  fill in this gap and contributes to advances in biological and behavioral  gerontology. Our recent studies demonstrated that this diurnal vertebrate with  gradual senescence is an excellent model in which to study age-dependent changes  in musculoskeletal and eye morphology, endocrine factors, gene expression,  circadian clock, sleep and cognitive functions. Importantly, we have also found  that the presence of a senescence-associated biomarker ('senescence-associated  beta-galactosidase') can be documented during early zebrafish development and is  predictive of premature aging phenotypes later in adult life. The availability of  mutant 'genotypes' with identified aging 'phenotypes' in zebrafish, in  combination with a wealth of information about zebrafish development and  genetics, and the existence of multiple mutant and transgenic lines, should  significantly facilitate the use of this outstanding vertebrate model in  deciphering the mechanisms of aging, and in developing preventive and therapeutic  strategies to prolong the productive life span ('health span') in humans.},

Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets.

Upon encountering water vibrations, larvae of the annelid Platynereis close their locomotor cilia and simultaneously raise the parapodia. The response is mediated by collar receptor neurons expressing the polycystins PKD1-1 and PKD2-1. CRISPR-generated PKD1-1 and PKD2-1 mutant larvae do not startle and fall prey to a copepod predator at a higher rate. Reconstruction of the whole-body connectome of the collar-receptor-cell circuitry revealed converging feedforward circuits to the ciliary bands and muscles. The wiring diagram suggests circuit mechanisms for the intersegmental and left-right coordination of the response.

The analyses of partial sequences from the nuclear 18S rRNA (643 bp) and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (577 bp) genes of representative individuals of all known chaetopterid genera indicated the initial assignment of the new species into Mesochaetopterus. These analyses also supported the monophyly of the family and revealed two well-supported clades: Chaetopterus/Mesochaetopterus and Spiochaetopterus/Phyllochaetopterus. Mesochaetopterus rogeri sp. nov. is close to Mesochaetopterus xerecus, which is redescribed here from newly collected material. Mesochaetopterus rogeri sp. nov. was characterized as follows: (1) two long tentacles with dorsal transversal black bands of alternating widths (sometimes with two additional longitudinal light-brown bands); (2) region A with nine chaetigers (up to 12), with 13–19 modified chaetae in the fourth chaetiger; (3) region B with three flat segments, with accessory feeding organs in the second and third segments; (4) sandy straight tubes, 2.5-m long or more, vertically embedded in the sand. In the Bay of Blanes, M. rogeri sp. nov. occurs between 6- and 9-m deep (but also up to 30-m deep), in a patchy distribution (\&lt; 1 individual m-2), with maximum densities in April/June (likely to be the result of recruitment events), and minimum densities in September/November (likely to be a behavioural response to increasing sediment dynamics). Although it was originally thought that M. rogeri sp. nov. could be an introduced species, we argue that it is probably a native of the Mediterranean that has been overlooked by scientists up to now.},

	abstract = {An extraordinary new species, Chaetopterus pugaporcinus, is described from eight specimens collected from deep mesopelagic waters off Monterey Bay, California, by remotely operated vehicles. All specimens exhibit a consistent combination of both adult and larval characteristics, leaving in question the maturity of the specimens. All specimens lack ciliated larval bands and the stout, modified chaetae (cutting spines) typically found in segment A4 of chaetopterids. If the specimens described here are larvae, they are remarkable for their size, which ranged from 10 to 21 mm total length, nearly twice the length of the largest polychaete larvae previously reported and 5 to 10 times larger than known chaetopterid larvae. Then too, their lack of segment addition prior to settlement would be atypical. If adult, they are particularly unusual in their habitat choice and body form. Morphology of the uncini and comparison to larval morphology indicated a close relationship to either Chaetopterus or Mesochaetopterus. However, the lack of cutting spines and typical adult morphology made it impossible to determine to what genus this species should be allied. Thus, we carried out the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Chaetopteridae in order to appropriately place and name the new species. Three partial genes were sequenced for 21 annelid species. The sequencing also provides the first molecular evidence that Chaetopterus variopedatus sensu Hartman (1959) is not a single cosmopolitan species. The question of C. pugaporcinus being a delayed larva or a genuine holopelagic chaetopterid is discussed.},

In 1904 the author was working out a collection made by him in Zanzibar and British East Africa (now Kenya Colony) while working for Sir Charles Eliot, G.C.M.G., F.Z.S., the High Commissioner. Finding that in the state of the literature at that time, certainty of discrimination of species would be assisted by a wider range for examination, and being particularly interested in comparing the faunas of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific areas, he applied to the Carnegie Trustees, who provided funds for an expedition to the Cape Verde Islands. While there he was offered by Professor Herdman a post under the Sudan Government to examine the Pearl Fishery of the Red Sea, and has been engaged there since. This is the origin of the fourth (RedSea) collection.},

They compose a traditional stable taxon recently supported as monophyletic but characterized by plesiomorphies. Most genera within the family have been recovered as paraphyletic in previous studies. We present a phylogenetic hypothesis for eunicid based on molecular (COI, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA) and morphological data (213 characters), including an explicit attempt to account for serial homology. Eunicidae as well as monophyletic genera \textit{Marphysa} sensu stricto and \textit{Lysidice} is redefined based on synapomorphies. \textit{Nematonereis} is synonymized to \textit{Lysidice}. \textit{Leodice} and \textit{Nicidion} are resurrected to name monophyletic groups including species previously included in \textit{Eunice} and \textit{Marphysa} sensu lato. Traditional diagnostic characters such as the absence/presence of peristomial cirri, lateral antennae and branchiae are homoplasies and not informative at the generic level. Different coding of traditional characters (i.e. articulation of prostomial appendages) and novel characters of prostomial features and regionalization of the body support the monophyly of the family and genera level clades. Thus, the phylogenetic hypothesis presented here and the evolution of characters provided background information for taxonomic changes yielding evolutionary meaningful classification and diagnoses for the family and genera.},

	abstract = {Abstract Diversification and speciation of terrestrial organisms are anticipated in oceanic islands such as Macaronesia, a group of Atlantic islands that have remained unconnected to continental landmasses. Hitherto, the diversification of marine organisms in oceanic islands, especially those with low vagility, has received little direct empirical analysis using molecular markers. Here, we focus on such a case study, through applying a multilocus molecular approach to investigate the diversity and evolution of a group that lacks a planktonic larval stage, the isopod genus Dynamene, in Macaronesia and Northeast Atlantic. Sequences of two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA) and two nuclear (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA) loci were obtained from specimens of Dynamene edwardsi (Lucas, 1849), Dynamene magnitorata Holdich, 1968 and Dynamene bidentata (Adams, 1800) collected along the Northeast Atlantic and Macaronesia. Although no major phylogeographic structure was detected in D. bidentata and D. magnitorata, from five to nine deeply divergent lineages were evident within D. edwardsi. The divergent lineages displayed genetic distances comparable to those found among established species of peracarids. D. edwardsi exhibits a long, rich and complex phylogeographic history in Macaronesia, where the geodynamics of the islands possibly associated with founder effects and subsequent lack of gene flow among populations confounds patterns based on geographic proximity of targeted populations. Our findings collectively suggest a much larger role of oceanic islands in the diversification of marine invertebrates than previously anticipated. The work provides insights into the origins and dynamics of ongoing geographic segregation and associated deep divergence among sister evolutionary lineages in Macaronesia.},

The Western Pacific abalones, Haliotis discus, H. madaka, and H. gigantea, occur in sympatry with shared breeding season and are capable of producing viable F1 hybrids in spite of being ecologically differentiated. Population genomic analyses revealed that although the three species are genetically distinct, there is evidence for historical and ongoing gene flow among these species. Evidence from demographic modeling suggests that reproductive isolation among the three species started to build in allopatry and has proceeded with gene flow, possibly driven by ecological selection. We identified 27 differentiation islands between the closely related H. discus and H. madaka characterized by high FST and dA, but not high dXY values, as well as high genetic diversity in one H. madaka population. These genomic signatures suggest differentiation driven by recent ecological divergent selection in presence of gene flow outside of the genomic islands of differentiation. The differentiation islands showed low polymorphism in H. gigantea, and both high FST, dXY, and dA values between H. discus and H. gigantea, as well as between H. madaka and H. gigantea. Collectively, the Western Pacific abalones appear to occupy the early stages speciation continuum, and the differentiation islands associated with ecological divergence among the abalones do not appear to have acted as barrier loci to gene flow in the younger divergences but appear to do so in older divergences.},

Syllis multiannulata sp. nov. is mainly characterised by its cylindrical broad body with annulated segments, weakly articulated antennae and cirri, dorsal cirri originating from two different levels, the presence of pre- and postchaetal parapodial lobes and the pharynx being shorter than the proventricle. Syllis pilosa sp. nov. is characterised by the presence of two marked ciliary bands per segment, elongated bidentate compound chaetae, and a very long pharynx and proventricle. Syllis rubicunda sp. nov. has a broad cylindrical body with distinct colour pattern, long and thick dorsal cirri, bidentate chaetae, and the pharyngeal tooth slightly removed from the anterior margin. Two species, revealing previously unreported morphological features, are also described and illustrated (Amblyosyllis speciosa Izuka, 1912 and Odontosyllis undecimdonta Imajima and Hartman, 1964).

species, in the taxonomically authoritative World Register of Marine Species and Catalogue

to terrestrial species described per year has increased, reflecting the less explored
nature of the oceans. From the mid-19th century, the cumulative number of species
described has been linear, with the highest number of species described in the decade of
1900, and fewer species described and fewer authors active during the World Wars. There
were more authors describing species since the 1960s, indicating greater taxonomic effort.
There were fewer species described per author since the 1920s, suggesting it has become
more difficult to discover new species. There was no evidence of any change in individual
effort by taxonomists. Using a nonhomogeneous renewal process model we predicted that
24–31\% to 21–29\% more marine and terrestrial species remain to be discovered,
respectively. We discuss why we consider that marine species comprise only 16\% of all
species on Earth although the oceans contain a greater phylogenetic diversity than occurs
on land. We predict that there may be 1.8–2.0 million species on Earth, of which about 0.3
million are marine, significantly less than some previous estimates.},

	abstract = {Exploring the effectiveness of DNA barcoding in species identification is a prerequisite for biodiversity conservation and environmental monitoring. Aquatic oligochaetes could serve as excellent indicators in aquatic monitoring programmes. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of DNA barcoding in these specific organisms. The mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (COI) gene of 83 specimens belonging to 40 species of 18 genera were sequenced in this study. The results showed that there was a barcode gap between species of Naididae and the intraspecific genetic distances of each species were smaller than interspecific genetic distances. The classification results of ABGD (Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery) were consistent with those of morphological identification, except for Tubifex tubifex and Lumbriculus variegatus. All species were successfully distinguished in the phylogenetic tree, based on the ITS2 region, which was coincident with the morphological result. Our results provided evidence that DNA barcoding can be used as an effective and convenient tool for species identification of the family Naididae and even for other aquatic oligochaetes.},

Phylogenetic relationships of arhynchobdellid (including Hirudinidae, Praobdellidae, Haemopidae, and Erpobdellidae) and rhynchobdellid (Glossiphoniidae) leeches were reconstructed, based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) locus, using both new sequence data and those available from GenBank. Our results suggest that each of Helobdella stagnalis (Linnaeus, 1758), Glossiphonia concolor (Aphathy, 1888), Erpobdella borisi Cichocka \& Bielecki, 2015, Dina lineata (O.F. Müller, 1774), Hirudo orientalis Utevsky and Trontelj, 2005, Haemopis sanguisuga (Linnaeus, 1758), Limnatis paluda (Tennent, 1859), and two unidentified species of Dina and Trocheta (these did not find species-level matches in GenBank) are present in Iran. A potential case of phenotypic change in response to ecological adaptation was observed in E. borisi insofar as two genetically identical sub- and super-terranean morphotypes were distinguished. The glossiphoniids of Iran and Europe are admixed in the phylogenetic tree, revealing low COI variation and no divergence within species between the continents for these taxa.},

	abstract = {The bristleworm family Eunicidae is distributed worldwide and well-known for the large size of many of its species, its hard jaws and its economic importance in the bait industry. Monophyly of Eunicidae has been contradicted in previous molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses focusing on Eunicida or on its type genus, Eunice. The current study focused on the phylogeny of the family per se combining mitochondrial and nuclear genes in different analyses. It recovered well-resolved phylogenetic hypotheses supporting the monophyly of Eunicidae and Palola, the only monophyletic genus among the genera for which we tested their monophyly (Eunice, Marphysa, Palola, Lysidice and Nematonereis). Four other stable clades containing the type species of different genera, or species deemed very similar to them, were recovered within Eunicidae. These clades may represent monophyletic redefinitions of current genera, except for Eunice, and of previous synonymized genera. Evolution of the number of peristomial cirri and prostomial appendages in Eunicidae happened by independent step-by-step reduction in the opposite order of their ontogenetic development, suggestive of sequential heterochrony. All three genes were informative, however, at different levels within the combined trees. 16S and COI were important in recovering a monophyletic Eunicidae and relationships within the family, while 18S was important in the resolution of basal eunicidan relationships, monophyly of Onuphidae and basal relationships within this family. Moreover, results of congruence tests (SH and WRST using PABA) indicate that hidden support is picked up in the combined analyses, which is not revealed in the single gene analyses. Further supporting the idea that congruence is not a requirement for combining different partitions.},

	abstract = {Platynereis dumerilii, a marine annelid, is a model animal that has gained popularity in various fields such as developmental biology, biological rhythms, nervous system organization and physiology, behaviour, reproductive biology, and epigenetic regulation. The transparency of P. dumerilii tissues at all developmental stages makes it easy to perform live microscopic imaging of all cell types. In addition, the slow-evolving genome of P. dumerilii and its phylogenetic position as a representative of the vast branch of Lophotrochozoans add to its evolutionary significance. Although P. dumerilii is amenable to transgenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, its relatively long and indefinite life cycle, as well as its semelparous reproduction have been hindrances to its adoption as a reverse genetics model. To overcome this limitation, an adapted culturing method has been developed allowing much faster life cycling, with median reproductive age at 15 weeks instead of 6-8 months using the traditional protocol. A low worm density in boxes and a strictly controlled feeding regime are important factors for the rapid growth and health of the worms. Moreover, a genetic selection for fast-reproducing individuals has been applied to isolate a “Fast Forward” strain that can be used for egg microinjection. This culture method has several advantages, such as being much more compact, not requiring air bubbling or an artificial moonlight regime for synchronized sexual maturation, and necessitating only limited water change. A full protocol for worm care and handling is provided.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {This review article provides a comprehensive account of the diversity of polychaetes associated to Indian mangrove ecosystems. Polychaetes constitute an important component in marine benthic communities and play a major ecological role in mangrove ecosystem. Information on polychaete diversity is available only from 12 mangroves out of 19 on the east coast and only from 11 out of 21 those of west coast of India. Altogether 385 species of polychaetes belonging to 176 genera under 49 families, representing 35.22\% of the total polychaetes in India, have been listed from mangroves skirting east and west coasts of India. Of this total, as many as 231 species of polychaetes in east coast and 230 species in mangroves of west coast of India were reported to occur. That way, species of the following families such as Nereididae, Spionidae, Terebellidae Sabellidae, Phyllodocidae, Eunicidae, Serpulidae, Lumbrinereidae, Onuphidae, Syllidae, Maldanidae, Capitellidae, and Glyceridae were found to be dominant in the mangrove environment. Among these, Genera Nereis, Glycera, Lumbriconereis, Prionospio were found to be dominant followed by Phyllodoce, Nephtys, Onuphis, Polydora, and Syllis in the next level of abundance. Regrettably, despite its immense role, studies related to polychaete diversity have been made only in 23 mangroves out of 40 mangroves in India. Compared to the studies carried out in other parts of the world, especially Western hemisphere, continuous survey is to be made along the mangroves of both the coasts of India focusing polychaetes, which attach quite a lot of ecological significance and economic importance.},

	abstract = {The Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (SPSPA) is located in the mid-equatorial Atlantic and represents a potentially important area for biodiversity research; however, its species diversity remains poorly characterized. Particularly, neglected groups such as invertebrates have not been thoroughly registered or described. For instance, no species inventory is provided for Annelida, the phylum to which segmented worms belong. This study represents the first polychaete species inventory from SPSPA, including genetic and morphological data. We have generated COI mtDNA and 16S rDNA sequences intended as DNA barcode to molecularly identify polychaete species via different methods. First, we used the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) identification tool; second, we calculated genetic distances and performed maximum likelihood trees with selected sequences from the Genbank database. We found that most species identified from SPSPA are strictly distributed in the Atlantic Ocean. Our methods proved that the accuracy of molecular identification was limited by the shortage of the annelid data available in BOLD and Genbank. Additionally, we describe a new species named Syllis belmontensis sp. nov. Overall, these results can be important resources for comparative studies on the distribution and genetic diversity of polychaetes worldwide.},

	abstract = {Annelida, traditionally divided into Polychaeta and Clitellata, are characterized by serial division of their body into numerous similar structures, the segments. In addition, there is a non-segmental part at the front end, the prostomium, and one at the back, the pygidium. New segments develop in a prepygidial proliferation zone. Each segment contains four groups of chaetae made up of β-chitin, a pair of coelomic cavities separated by mesenteries, and septa. The nervous system is a rope-ladder-like ventral nerve cord with a dorsal brain in the prostomium. For the last stem species a trochophore larva and a benthic adult are commonly postulated. There are two conflicting hypotheses describing the systematization of Annelida: the first postulates a sister-group relationship of Polychaeta and Clitellata, the second sees Clitellata as a highly derived taxon forming a subordinate taxon within the polychaetes which, consequently, are regarded as paraphyletic. Depending on the hypothesis, different characters have to be postulated for the stem species of Annelida. Besides segmentation other characters such as nuchal organs, palps and antennae, body wall musculature, cuticle, parapodia as well as structure of the central nervous system and the foregut play an important role in this discussion. Here, the different characters and character states are critically reviewed and analyzed with respect to morphology and function. The consequences for systematization of their phylogenetic interpretation as autapomorphies, synapomorphies or plesiomorphies are outlined. The resulting hypotheses are compared with those relying on molecular data sets.},

The new species is distinguished from other Dodecaceria species by having lateral tentacles, a smooth peristomium, 3–5 pairs of branchiae, hooks from chaetiger 11 in notopodia and 9 in neuropodia. Dodecaceria dibranchiata, a Caribbean species, is here recorded for the first time in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {C-type allatostatins (C-type ASTs) are a family of structurally related neuropeptides found in a wide range of insects and crustaceans. To date, the C-type allatostatin receptor in crustaceans has not been deorphaned, and little is known about its physiological functions. In this study, we aimed to functionally deﬁne a C-type ASTs receptor in the mud crab, Scylla paramamosian. We showed that C-type ASTs receptor can be activated by ScypaAST-C peptide in a dose-independent manner and by ScypaAST-CCC peptide in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 6.683 nM. Subsequently, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to investigate the potential roles of ScypaAST-C and ScypaAST-CCC peptides in the regulation of ecdysone (20E) and methyl farnesoate (MF) biosynthesis. The results indicated that ScypaAST-C inhibited biosynthesis of 20E in the Y-organ, whereas ScypaAST-CCC had no effect on the production of 20E. In addition, qRT-PCR showed that both ScypaAST-C and ScypaAST-CCC signiﬁcantly decreased the level of expression of the MF biosynthetic enzyme gene in the mandibular organ, suggesting that the two neuropeptides have a negative effect on the MF biosynthesis in mandibular organs. In conclusion, this study provided new insight into the physiological roles of AST-C in inhibiting ecdysone biosynthesis. Furthermore, it was revealed that AST-C family peptides might inhibit MF biosynthesis in crustaceans.},

	abstract = {Regeneration is the process by which many animals are able to restore lost or injured body parts. After amputation of the posterior part of its body, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii is able to regenerate the pygidium, the posteriormost part of its body that bears the anus, and a subterminal growth zone containing stem cells that allows the subsequent addition of new segments. The ability to regenerate their posterior part (posterior regeneration) is promoted, in juvenile worms, by a hormone produced by the brain and is lost when this hormonal activity becomes low at the time the worms undergo their sexual maturation. By characterizing posterior regeneration at the morphological and molecular levels in worms that have been decapitated, we show that the presence of the head is essential for multiple aspects of posterior regeneration, as well as for the subsequent production of new segments. We also show that methylfarnesoate, the molecule proposed to be the brain hormone, can partially rescue the posterior regeneration defects observed in decapitated worms. Our results are therefore consistent with a key role of brain hormonal activity in the control of regeneration and growth in P. dumerilii, and support the hypothesis of the involvement of methylfarnesoate in this control.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-906},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii is emerging as a powerful lophotrochozoan experimental model for evolutionary developmental biology  (evo-devo) and neurobiology. Recent studies revealed the presence of conserved  neuropeptidergic signaling in Platynereis, including vasotocin/neurophysin,  myoinhibitory peptide and opioid peptidergic systems. Despite these advances,  comprehensive peptidome resources have yet to be reported. RESULTS: The present  work describes the neuropeptidome of Platynereis. We established a large  transcriptome resource, consisting of stage-specific next-generation sequencing  datasets and 77,419 expressed sequence tags. Using this information and a  combination of bioinformatic searches and mass spectrometry analyses, we  increased the known proneuropeptide (pNP) complement of Platynereis to 98. Based  on sequence homology to metazoan pNPs, Platynereis pNPs were grouped into ancient  eumetazoan, bilaterian, protostome, lophotrochozoan, and annelid families, and  pNPs only found in Platynereis. Compared to the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea,  the only other lophotrochozoan with a large-scale pNP resource, Platynereis has a  remarkably full complement of conserved pNPs, with 53 pNPs belonging to ancient  eumetazoan or bilaterian families. Our comprehensive search strategy, combined  with analyses of sequence conservation, also allowed us to define several novel  lophotrochozoan and annelid pNP families. The stage-specific transcriptome  datasets also allowed us to map changes in pNP expression throughout the  Platynereis life cycle. CONCLUSION: The large repertoire of conserved pNPs in  Platynereis highlights the usefulness of annelids in comparative  neuroendocrinology. This work establishes a reference dataset for comparative  peptidomics in lophotrochozoans and provides the basis for future studies of  Platynereis peptidergic signaling.},

	abstract = {Vitellogenesis (yolk accumulation) begins upon eclosion and continues through the process of sexual maturation. Upon reaching sexual maturity, vitellogenesis is placed on hold until it is induced again by mating. However, the mechanisms that gate vitellogenesis in response to developmental and reproductive signals remain unclear. Here, we have identified the neuropeptide allatostatin-C (AstC)-producing neurons that gate both the initiation of vitellogenesis that occurs post-eclosion and its re-initiation post-mating. During sexual maturation, the AstC neurons receive excitatory inputs from Sex Peptide Abdominal Ganglion (SAG) neurons. In mature virgin females, high sustained activity of SAG neurons shuts off vitellogenesis via continuous activation of the AstC neurons. Upon mating, however, Sex Peptide inhibits SAG neurons, leading to deactivation of the AstC neurons. As a result, this permits both JH biosynthesis and the progression of vitellogenesis in mated females. Our work has uncovered a central neural circuit that gates the progression of oogenesis.},

This change between life-cycle stages is often associated with a change in diet or a transition between a non-feeding and a feeding form. How larvae regulate changes in feeding during this life-cycle transition is not well understood. Neuropeptides are known to regulate several aspects of feeding, such as food search, ingestion and digestion. The marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has a complex life cycle with a pelagic non-feeding larval stage and a benthic feeding postlarval stage, linked by the process of settlement. The conserved neuropeptide myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) is a key regulator of larval settlement behavior in Platynereis. Whether MIP also regulates the initiation of feeding, another aspect of the pelagic-to-benthic transition in Platynereis, is currently unknown.},

Here we use transmission electron microscopy and gene expression mapping to analyze the synaptic and peptidergic connectome of an entire neurosecretory center. We reconstructed 78 neurosecretory neurons and mapped their synaptic connectivity in the brain of larval Platynereis dumerilii, a marine annelid. These neurons form an anterior neurosecretory center expressing many neuropeptides, including hypothalamic peptide orthologs and their receptors. Analysis of peptide-receptor pairs in spatially mapped single-cell transcriptome data revealed sparsely connected networks linking specific neuronal subsets. We experimentally analyzed one peptide-receptor pair and found that a neuropeptide can couple neurosecretory and synaptic brain signaling. Our study uncovered extensive networks of peptidergic signaling within a neurosecretory center and its connection to the synaptic brain.},

To investigate this diversity, a transcriptomic survey of the visceral ganglia (VG) was carried out over an annual reproductive cycle. RNA-seq data from 26 samples corresponding to VG at different stages of reproduction were de novo assembled to generate a specific reference transcriptome of the oyster nervous system and used to identify differentially expressed transcripts. Transcriptome mining led to the identification of novel neuropeptide precursors (NPPs) related to the bilaterian Eclosion Hormone (EH), crustacean female sex hormone/Interleukin 17, Nesfatin, neuroparsin/IGFBP, prokineticins, and urotensin I; to the protostome GNQQN, pleurin, prohormones 3 and 4, prothoracotropic hormones (PTTH), and QSamide/PXXXamide; to the lophotrochozoan CCWamide, CLCCY, HFAamide, and LXRX; and to the mollusk-specific NPPs CCCGS, clionin, FYFY, GNamide, GRWRN, GSWN, GWE, IWMPxxGYxx, LXRYamide, RTLFamide, SLRFamide, and WGAGamide.

So far, the cellular mechanisms underlying regeneration in annelids remain elusive. To precisely determine the origin(s), plasticity and fate of the cells participating in the blastema formation during posterior regeneration in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, we developed specific tools to track proliferative cells as well as gut epithelial cells. We showed that two populations of progenitors are at play during regeneration and that, among them, gut progenitors from differentiated tissues are lineage-restricted. Strikingly, gut progenitors from less differentiated and more proliferative tissues are much more plastic and can produce ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives, in addition to gut cells. However, their plasticity is de facto limited as exemplified by their inability to regenerate populations of stem cells responsible for the constant growth of the worms. We evidenced that those stem cells are from local origin (i.e. from the segment abutting the amputation plan) as most of the blastema cells. Our results are in favour of a hybrid and flexible cellular model for posterior regeneration in Platynereis relying on a gradient of cell plasticity along the antero-posterior axis of the animal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {An ability to delay aging—or to reverse the negative effects of aging—could prevent age-related disease and greatly enhance quality of life in old age. However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered “immortal” due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods  through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is  suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some  shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.  RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and  introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into  chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times.  For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts  of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries  against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking  information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular  software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data  sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a  user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be  uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new  BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate  substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length  database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line  applications.},
