Currently, her postdoctoral research is focused on understanding how these organisms regenerate there germ cells, and the dynamics of germ cell differentiation.

Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 2015.\nBSc. in Biology. State University of Maranhão, Brazil. 2013.\nMore information on my CV.\n\n\nBiography\nI come from São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil, with a diverse heritage that includes Native Brazilian ancestry from the Guajajara tribe, as well as African and Iberian roots. My interest in science began at a young age, and I eventually became a biologist. During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to a remarkable realm inhabited by creatures both delicate and conspicuous—polychaete annelids, which are marine segmented worms. I have navigated through various projects studying these worms, spanning taxonomy, ecology, reproduction, and ultimately, regeneration. Sometimes my adventures led me to the middle of a mangrove, collecting worms from the mud; sometimes, I found myself scuba diving in paradisiacal oceanic islands, and most times, I was on the lab bench, pipetting or counting segments.\nEach adventure has contributed to my understanding of how amazing these worms are. Fascinated by their remarkable regenerative abilities, my research has become a quest to comprehend the mechanisms by which their cells proliferate and differentiate. Additionally, I am continually amazed by how these mechanisms enable these worms to defy the passage of time and live indefinitely. Ultimately, they inspired me to start a sci-art project to communicate my findings using comics.\nWhile I enjoy my work, I prioritize a balanced lifestyle by spending quality time with my family and friends, and maintaining a fitness routine for strength. Having hobbies is essential for me, and aside from playing guitar for enjoyment, I immerse myself in my love for dancing. I enjoy exploring diverse dance styles such as salsa, bachata, kizomba, as well as Brazilian styles like forró, axé and more.\n\n\nHow to pronounce my name\nI go by Ranny, pronounced as “hun-ny”."
