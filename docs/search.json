    "section": "",
    "text": "Comics are a fun and versatile way to communicate complex ideas. As a comic enthusiast, I began illustrating them to share my research findings. I’ve crafted comic strips for some of my scientific publications, blending storytelling with science in an engaging format. Rather than following a rigid publishing schedule, I allow my creativity and current mindset to shape the scientific narratives I bring to life.\nExpanding on this passion, I launched Wormly Speaking—a project dedicated to giving voice to the fascinating yet often overlooked polychaete worms. Through this channel, my mission is to empower and inspire us with hopeful stories while also sharing the remarkable traits of these worms, such as their reproduction styles and ability to regenerate. These worms have been my role model of resilience during hard transitional times in my life. Take a peek at the stories I’ve created so far— they may be hopeful worms for you too!\nFollow Wormly Speaking: https://www.instagram.com/wormlyspeaking/\n\nSyllis in Wonderland - Part II.

Check it out: https://doi.org/10.1111/ede.12492, Evolution & Development.\nSyllis malaquini is a species of marine segmented worm that we found in an aquarium.

During her PhD, she investigated the relationship between regeneration and reproduction under an evolutionary perspective. Using diverse tools such as RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, and immunohistochemistry, she characterized cellular proliferation and the transcriptomic profile of anterior and posterior body regeneration in a specific group of annelids called syllids. Currently, her postdoctoral research is focused on understanding how these organisms regenerate there germ cells, and the dynamics of germ cell differentiation. Annelids stand out from other highly regenerative organisms like planarians and cnidarians due to the absence of specialized stem cells dedicated to regeneration. This absence raises an intriguing question: how do they achieve remarkable regenerative feats without relying on specific cell types? Unraveling this mystery holds the potential to manipulate regenerative processes in various cell types, including those found in vertebrates."

Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 2015.\nBSc. in Biology. State University of Maranhão, Brazil. 2013.\nMore information on my CV.\n\n\nBiography\nI come from São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil, with a diverse heritage that includes Native Brazilian ancestry from the Guajajara tribe, as well as African and Iberian roots. My interest in science began at a young age, and I eventually became a biologist. During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to a remarkable realm inhabited by creatures both delicate and conspicuous—polychaete annelids, which are marine segmented worms. I have navigated through various projects studying these worms, spanning taxonomy, ecology, reproduction, and ultimately, regeneration. Sometimes my adventures led me to the middle of a mangrove, collecting worms from the mud; sometimes, I found myself scuba diving in paradisiacal oceanic islands, and most times, I was on the lab bench, pipetting or counting segments.\nEach adventure has contributed to my understanding of how amazing these worms are. Fascinated by their remarkable regenerative abilities, my research has become a quest to comprehend the mechanisms by which their cells proliferate and differentiate. Additionally, I am continually amazed by how these mechanisms enable these worms to defy the passage of time and live indefinitely. Ultimately, they inspired me to start a sci-art project to communicate my findings using comics.\nWhile I enjoy my work, I prioritize a balanced lifestyle by spending quality time with my family and friends, and maintaining a fitness routine for strength. Having hobbies is essential for me, and aside from playing guitar for enjoyment, I immerse myself in my love for dancing. I enjoy exploring diverse dance styles such as salsa, bachata, kizomba, as well as Brazilian styles like forró, axé and more.\n\n\nHow to pronounce my name\nI go by Ranny, pronounced as “hun-ny”."
