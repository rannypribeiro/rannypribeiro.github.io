I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Ã–zpolat Lab at Washington University in St. Louis. My primary research interest lies in exploring **regeneration in segmented worms**. Regeneration served as a key factor for investigating sex differences in my latest project, which focuses on uncovering sex-biased differences in the segmented worm *Platyneries dumerilii*, using RNA sequencing. Future endeavors will center on unraveling the remarkable plasticity of segmented worm cells and their ability to undergo multiple rounds of regeneration endlessly.
