<p style="text-align: center;">

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Ã–zpolat Lab at Washington University in St. Louis. My primary research interest lies in exploring **regeneration in segmented worms**. Regeneration served as a key factor in my current project, which focuses on uncovering sex-biased differences in the segmented worm *Platyneries dumerilii*, using RNA sequencing.
