<p style="text-align: center;">

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Özpolat Lab](https://bduyguozpolat.org/) at Washington University in St. Louis, where I study the remarkable biology of polychaete worms. I have long been fascinated by their extraordinary regenerative abilities—some species can regrow tails, others can regenerate both heads and tails, and these capacities are deeply intertwined with their reproductive strategies and evolution. My research now focuses on the intersection of **regeneration, reproduction, and aging**, revealing how regeneration itself can act as a pro-longevity factor. Through combining morphology, experimental biology with next-generation sequencing, and genome editing approaches, I aim to uncover the molecular secrets behind this paradox and share how these tiny marine creatures can transform our understanding of healthspan and resilience.
