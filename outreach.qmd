### Rapid Fire Round

Ranny currently serves as the Outreach Director of the WashU Postdoc Society (WUPS).

Under her leadership, the Outreach Committee of WUPS started a series of interviews with postdocs to showcase their work and value. Many people are unaware of what it means to be a postdoc, and through these interviews, we aim to communicate this to a broader audience, even sharing it with our families. On a lighter note, when discussing this project, I was inspired by my grandparents, who still think I am a student. They're not entirely wrong, because being a scientist involves a lifelong journey of studying, albeit to produce knowledge. And knowledge is invaluable!
