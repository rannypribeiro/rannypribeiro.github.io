## WUPS Outreach

Ranny is an active member of both the Outreach Committee and the Career Development Committee of the WashU Postdoctoral Society. She has contributed to various initiatives, including the Table Topics, Rapid Fire Round and the WUPS Podcast.

### Rapid Fire Round

The WUPS Outreach Committee launched a series of interviews with postdocs to showcase their work and value during Ranny's tenure as Outreach Director of the WashU Postdoc Society (WUPS) from 2023 to 2024. These interviews aim to inform a broader audience, including our own families, about the role and significance of postdocs. Personally, I was inspired by my grandparents, who still think I am a student. They're not entirely wrong, as being a scientist is a lifelong journey of learning and producing knowledgeâ€”an invaluable product!

### WUPS podcast

Expanding on the goals of the Rapid Fire Round, the WUPS Outreach Committee introduced a podcast. In this new format, we interview postdocs, faculty members, and other researchers to discuss science in both audio and video formats. The podcast is hosted by Dr. [Rishabh Bajpai](https://www.rishabh-bajpai.com/), with Ranny and other Outreach Committee members contributing to tasks such as developing questions and advertising.
