### Rapid Fire Round

Ranny currently serves as the Outreach Director of the WashU Postdoc Society (WUPS).

During her leadership, the Outreach Committee of WUPS started a series of interviews with postdocs to showcase their work and value. Many people don't know what is to be a postdoc and by releasing these interviews we can communicute to the broaden audience and even share it with our families. Jokes apart: when discussing about this project, I was inspired by my grandparents who still thinks I am a student. She is not totally worng, because this is what scientist do the whole life: they study, but to produce knowledge. And knowledge is valuable!

You can find more about our interviews with WashU postdocs on our: [Rapid Fire Round](https://sites.wustl.edu/wupostdocsociety/who-are-we/rapid-fire-round-with-a-postdoc-2-2-2/).
