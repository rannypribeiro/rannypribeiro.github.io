Today, my mentee Kaitlyn presented our research at the Fall Undergraduate Symposium, and I couldn't be more thrilled and proud of her achievement. This event is a fantastic opportunity for undergrad students to showcase their research experience and gain some communication skills. Congrats, Kaitlyn!
