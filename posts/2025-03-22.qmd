After Janelia, I was awarded another exciting opportunity—this time to present my outreach work as a member and 2023–2024 leader of the WashU Postdoctoral Society. Alongside Sandhya Tripathi, PhD, we showcased the initiatives of the Outreach Committee through print media and events we organized. We also led a 60-minute workshop for about 20 attendees, where we discussed programs like the Rapid Fire Round, our podcast, and Brews and Brains, among other initiatives. More about our outreach on [WUPS website](https://sites.wustl.edu/wupostdocsociety/about/).
