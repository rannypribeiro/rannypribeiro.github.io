How do worms make eggs and sperm? In our latest study in the [Ã–zpolat Lab](https://bduyguozpolat.org/), we uncover the transcriptional signatures of gametogenesis in the segmented worm *Platynereis dumerilii*. Using RNA-seq, we show how sex-biased gene expressionâ€”including *dmrt1* and a newly identified gene, *psmt*â€”emerges as worms mature. Our work provides new tools for sex identification and lays the groundwork for exploring germ cell evolution. And guess what.. we got the cover!
