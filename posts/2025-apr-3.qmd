I am so happy to share that Kaitlyn has recently been accepted as an intern in the [Northwestern Medicine Pre-Med Internship Program](https://www.nm.org/for-medical-professionals/i-am-a-student/northwestern-medicine-pre-med-internship-program). I have been mentoring her for the past 2 years and she is such an outstanding pre-med student. Congrats, Kaitlyn!
