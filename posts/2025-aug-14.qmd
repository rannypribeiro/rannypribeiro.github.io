Thrilled and honored to receive one of the [Best Presentation Awards](https://bsky.app/profile/isrbio.bsky.social/post/3lwqswrf5s22n) at the Biennial Meeting of the International Society for Regenerative Biology, where I shared my current work on regeneration. The conference was an inspiring experience filled with new insights and connections. It was such a great a memorable event and I'm grateful for the recognition among outstanding peers.

Thank you to the organizing committee for their dedication and excellence in bringing together the [regenerative biology community](https://bsky.app/profile/isrbio.bsky.social/post/3lwopir4qj22s). Congratulations to everyone involved for making this meeting so impactful.
