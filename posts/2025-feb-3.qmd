Today, I was thrilled to receive a **seed grant** to support my research on highly regenerative animal models! The journey to this achievement was both exciting and rewarding. I was selected as one of the **five finalists** and had the opportunity to present my pitch at a fun and engaging event. I’m proud to share that I was awarded **\$15,000** for my research. This marks my first grant, and I couldn’t be more excited about this milestone!

I’m also incredibly happy for my friend and colleague, **Yu Seon Kim, PhD**, who is also a member of the WUPS Outreach Committee with me. Together with Yu Seon we made **top two** in the competition. It was a fantastic experience to celebrate this achievement together. Also, a huge thank you to **Yu Seon** for capturing the moment with a photo.

My sincere acknowledgments to my mentors, Dr. **Duygu Özpolat** and **Dr. Kerry Kornfeld** andall the members of the **Özpolat Lab** for their invaluable feedback, which played a fundamental role in helping me deliver a strong and impactful presentation.

This grant is just the beginning, and I’m excited to see where this research takes us next!
