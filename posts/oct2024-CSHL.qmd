This was my first time attending the Germ Cells Meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and I enjoyed every moment. I am returning home with many wonderful memories and valuable insights gained from this remarkable community of researchers. A highlight was the opportunity to toast with the 2024 Nobel Prize winners in Physiology and Medicine via videoconference, which added a special touch to the event. Also, I loved these cute Halloween decorations!
