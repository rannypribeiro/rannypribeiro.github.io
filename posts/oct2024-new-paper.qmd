Publication alert!! Today we published another paper on regeneration. This time we made many experiments to discover how many segments *Syllis malaquini*. to regenerate the whole-body. We found that this species need three segments to complete both anterior and posterior regeneration, but with just two segments it already regenerate at least the head and tail. That's amazing. Check it out: <https://doi.org/10.1111/ede.12492>, Evolution & Development.

*Syllis malaquini* is a species of marine segmented worm that we found in an aquarium. Since then, we keep the worms in an aquarium reproducing mostly by asexual architomic fission. Details on our first publication on this worm: <https://doi.org/10.1007/s12526-020-01046-y>
