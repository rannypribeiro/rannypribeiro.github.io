## Teaching

### Courseware development

I like to employ different strategies for teaching. Recently, I took advantage of the flipped classroom concept and I developed some course material based on gamification. I think it is an effective approach for teaching and learning. I've crafted some resources for classes of Embryology, Zoology, English in three languages (Portuguese, Spanish and English). I used the platform [Genially](https://genial.ly/) to build these games. I absolutely recommend it. Also, I published a article about my experience using some the series "Gamizoo" during lab course of Zoology. Check this and more under Publications.

## Bioinformatics and coding resources

Helpful resources I utilize in Bioinformatics are accessible through my [GitHub account](https://github.com/rannypribeiro).

I created this website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It is easy and quick to manage, if you are familiar with RStudio and R coding. Theme: flatly.

## Mental Health and Professional Development

I believe that overall health should be our priority. Initially, the academic environment may pose challenges such as job insecurity, making it difficult to persevere and build resilience. Access to medical care and self-help resources is crucial. Here's a list of my favorite resources that help me stay resilient, including books, podcasts and videos. Yes, stoicism is my lifestyle philosophy!
