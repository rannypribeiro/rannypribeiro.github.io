Comics can be a fun and versatile communication resource. As a comic enthusiast, I began illustrating some to creatively convey my research findings. My goal is to craft a unique comic for each of my future publications whenever feasible. Rather than adhering to a strict publishing schedule, I let my creativity and current mindset guide me through the scientific storytelling process. Take a peek at the comics I have created thus far.
