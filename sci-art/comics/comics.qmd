title: Comics - Wormly Speaking

Comics are a fun and versatile way to communicate complex ideas. As a comic enthusiast, I began illustrating them to share my research findings. I’ve crafted comic strips for some of my scientific publications, blending storytelling with science in an engaging format. Rather than following a rigid publishing schedule, I allow my creativity and current mindset to shape the scientific narratives I bring to life.

Expanding on this passion, I launched **Wormly Speaking**—a project dedicated to giving voice to the fascinating yet often overlooked polychaete worms. Through this channel, my mission is to empower and inspire us with hopeful stories while also sharing the remarkable traits of these worms, such as their reproduction styles and ability to regenerate. These worms have been my role model of resilience during hard transitional times in my life. Take a peek at the stories I’ve created so far— they may be **hopeful worms** for you too!
