title: Comics - Wormly Speaking
lightbox: true
---

Comics are a fun way to communicate complex ideas. As a comic lover, I started illustrating them to share the stories behind my research papers, blending storytelling with science in an engaging format.

From this spark, I launched **Wormly Speaking**—a cozy nook where the fascinating, often-overlooked polychaete worms get their time to shine. Through this project, my mission is to empower and inspire us with hopeful stories while also sharing the remarkable traits of these worms, such as their unique reproductive and regenerative biology. Take a peek at the stories I’ve created so far.
