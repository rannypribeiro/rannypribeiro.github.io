During her PhD, she investigated the relationship between regeneration and reproduction under an evolutionary perspective. Using diverse tools such as RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, and immunohistochemistry, she characterized cellular proliferation and the transcriptomic profile of anterior and posterior body regeneration in a specific group of annelids called syllids. Currently, her postdoctoral research is focused on understanding how these organisms regenerate there germ cells, and the dynamics of germ cell differentiation. Annelids stand out from other highly regenerative organisms like planarians and cnidarians due to the absence of specialized stem cells dedicated to regeneration. This absence raises an intriguing question: how do they achieve remarkable regenerative feats without relying on specific cell types? Unraveling this mystery holds the potential to manipulate regenerative processes in various cell types, including those found in vertebrates."

Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain. 2021.\nMSc. in Environmental Sciences and Conservation. Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 2015.\nBSc. in Biology. State University of Maranhão, Brazil. 2013.\n\n\nBiography\nI come from São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil, with a diverse heritage that includes Native Brazilian ancestry from the Guajajara tribe, as well as African and Iberian roots. My interest in science began at a young age, and I eventually became a biologist. During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to a remarkable realm inhabited by creatures both delicate and conspicuous—polychaete annelids, which are marine segmented worms. I have navigated through various projects studying these worms, spanning taxonomy, ecology, reproduction, and ultimately, regeneration. Sometimes my adventures led me to the middle of a mangrove, collecting worms from the mud; sometimes, I found myself scuba diving in paradisiacal oceanic islands, and most times, I was on the lab bench, pipetting or counting segments.\nEach adventure has contributed to my understanding of how amazing these worms are. Fascinated by their remarkable regenerative abilities, my research has become a quest to comprehend the mechanisms by which their cells proliferate and differentiate. Additionally, I am continually amazed by how these mechanisms enable these worms to defy the passage of time and live indefinitely. Ultimately, they inspired me to start a sci-art project to communicate my findings using comics.\nWhile I enjoy my work, I prioritize a balanced lifestyle by spending quality time with my family and friends, and maintaining a fitness routine for strength. Having hobbies is essential for me, and aside from playing guitar for enjoyment, I immerse myself in my love for dancing. I enjoy exploring diverse dance styles such as salsa, bachata, kizomba, as well as Brazilian styles like forró, axé, funk, and pisadinha. I’m also a beginner in pole dancing."

Initially, the academic environment may pose challenges such as job insecurity, making it difficult to persevere and build resilience. Access to medical care and self-help resources is crucial. Here’s a list of my favorite resources that help me stay resilient, including books and videos. Stoicism is my lifestyle philosophy!\n\nLetters from a Stoic, by Seneca\nMeditations, by Marcus Aurelius\nAmar, desamar, amar de novo, by Marcos Lacerda.\nAmar-se, uma viagem em busca de si mesmo, by Marcos Lacerda.\nASMR videos. This is an amazing relaxation technique. I super recommend it.\nAbout Mental Health."
